An executable is copied from system32\n\ninto a different directory and Dridex\u2019s DLL is placed in that same directory. The malicious DLL mimics a legitimate DLL that\u2019s loaded by the\n\nexecutable.\n\nAccording to Windows \ufb01le path priority, the malicious DLL gets loaded instead of the original one, which is located in system32. These setups\n\nare placed in system32 and %AppData% folders and executed by registry run keys and scheduled tasks.\n\nX-Force research noted that this method was already observed in some of the last v3 builds detected in the past few months, but v4 has fully\n\nadopted this robustness-over-stealth approach for its persistence mechanism.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Dridex malware project continues to evolve, and 2017 is likely to be another year of change for this Trojan.\n\nOver the long reign of Dridex v3, we have seen some signi\ufb01cant changes implemented into the malware\u2019s operations, such as modi\ufb01ed anti-\n\nresearch techniques (https://securityintelligence.com/protected-api-calls-and-string-constants-looting-dridexs-candy-box/), redirection attacks\n\n(https://securityintelligence.com/dridex-launches-dyre-like-attacks-in-uk-intensi\ufb01es-focus-on-business-accounts/) and fraudulent M.O.\n\nchanges. It is not surprising to see a new major version released from this gang\u2019s developers.\n\nIn this release, we noted that special attention was given to dodging antivirus (AV) products and hindering research by adopting a series of\n\nenhanced anti-research and anti-AV capabilities.\n\nThe changes to Dridex\u2019s code injection method are among the most signi\ufb01cant enhancements in v4. They allow Dridex to propagate in the\n\ninfected endpoint with minimal calls to marked API functions.\n\nThe adoption of a new injection technique shortly after its discovery demonstrates Dridex\u2019s efforts to keep up with the times and the evolution of\n\nsecurity controls. Although they relied on a publicized method, Dridex\u2019s developers created their own version of it, a choice that is consistent\n\nwith their usual preference to write proprietary code schemes for Dridex, as they did for its binary con\ufb01guration format, for example.\n\nIOCs\n\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/dridexs-cold-war-enter-atombombing/\n\n6/8\n\n\f3/1/2017\n\nDridex's Cold War: Enter AtomBombing\n\nIn this research we analyzed Dridex sample MD5s 4599fca4b67c9c216c6dea42214fd1ce and 1e6c6123af04d972b61cd3cde5e0658e.\n\nDridex is featured in an X-Force Exchange (https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/threat-intelligence-api?\n\nce=ISM0484&ct=SWG&cmp=IBMSocial&cm=h&cr=Security&ccy=US) collection, which is updated regularly. You can view the collection and\n\ncontribute to it here (https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Dridex-Ongoing-Collection-e49edad121083d7986dc35009dbdeeae).\n\nIBM Security has a great deal of information on Dridex v4 and its attack schemes and can help banks and other targeted organizations learn\n\nmore about this high-risk threat. To help stop threats like Dridex, banks and service providers can use adaptive solutions to detect infections\n\nand protect customer endpoints (http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/trusteer-rapport?\n\nce=ISM0484&ct=SWG&cmp=IBMSocial&cm=h&cr=Security&ccy=US) when malware evolves or enhances its focus on the organization\u2019s\n\nlocale.\n\nFighting evolving threats such as Dridex attacks can be made easier with the right malware detection solutions (http://www-\n\n03.ibm.com/software/products/en/trusteer-pinpoint-detect?ce=ISM0484&ct=SWG&cmp=IBMSocial&cm=h&cr=Security&ccy=US). With\n\nprotection layers designed to address the ever-changing threat landscape, \ufb01nancial organizations can bene\ufb01t from malware intelligence that\n\nprovides real-time insight into fraudster techniques and capabilities.\n\nConsumers wishing to protect themselves from malware infections on endpoints and mobile devices are invited to read our best practices page\n\n(https://securityintelligence.com/mitigating-malware-modern-mobile-world/).\n\nREAD THE WHITE PAPER: HOW TO OUTSMART FRAUDSTERS WITH COGNITIVE FRAUD DETECTION \n\nh\n\n (HTTPS://WWW-\n\n01.IBM.COM/MARKETING/IWM/DRE/SIGNUP?SOURCE=MRS-FORM-\n9451&S_PKG=OV54550&CE=ISM0484&CT=SWG&CMP=IBMSOCIAL&CM=H&CR=SECURITY&CCY=US)\n\nTags:\u00a0 Advanced Threats (https://securityintelligence.com/tag/advanced-threats/) \u00a0|\u00a0 Dridex (https://securityintelligence.com/tag/dridex/) \u00a0|\u00a0 Financial Malware\n(https://securityintelligence.com/tag/\ufb01nancial-malware/) \u00a0|\u00a0 IBM X-Force (https://securityintelligence.com/tag/ibm-x-force/) \u00a0|\u00a0 IBM X-Force Exchange\n\n(https://securityintelligence.com/tag/ibm-x-force-exchange/) \u00a0|\u00a0 IBM X-Force Research (https://securityintelligence.com/tag/ibm-x-force-research/) \u00a0|\u00a0 Malware\n(https://securityintelligence.com/tag/malware/)\n\nShare this Article: x   t   u\n\nMagal Baz (https://securityintelligence.com/author/magal-baz/)\n\nMalware Researcher, IBM Trusteer\n\nMagal Baz is a malware researcher for IBM Security's Trusteer's group.
