All start with a heading RTF \ncontent (which is exactly the same in all of the documents), followed by the block that exploits \nthe CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability, along with the first stage shellcode, followed by the second \nand third stage shellcodes, and finally the encrypted payload executable.\n\nRTF heading of exploited documents\n\nThe shellcode itself is encrypted with a 4 byte XOR algorithm, with a lot of inserted junk \ninstructions:\n\nfprem1 \nadd \njz \nnop \nfnclex \nfldl2e \nnop \nand \ntest   \nfsin \nxor \njp \nf2xm1 \nmov \nnop \ncld \nfst \npop \njle \nfldpi \nfprem1 \ncmp \nfdivrp  \n\nedi, ebx \nshort loc_13B \n\nebx, ebx \neax, eax \n\n[edi], esi \nshort loc_14B \n\nedx, edx \n\nst(1) \nedi \nshort loc_157 \n\nedi, esi \nst(1), st\n\nIn the above code sample, only the XOR [EDI], ESI instruction is meaningful, performing the \ndecryption of the one dword; the rest are only polymorphic junk.\n\n17\n\nA SophosLabs technical paper - February 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fPlugX goes to the registry (and India)\n\nThe underlying shellcode is multi-stage andhas already been observed in an earlier sample \ndropping a PlugX v2 variant (SHA1: 9b90d6608ba6167619b5991fd70319dfcd1fa881, date \nconstant 0x20140613), but in that case without the top level cryptor.\n\nAfter the initial bootstrap code is decrypted, it identifies the carrier by looking for \u2018DCBA\u2019 at file \noffset 0x4e28. If it is found there, it allocates a memory area and decrypts (using one byte XOR \nalgorithm) the next stage starting from right after the ID string.\n\nThe second stage code decrypts and drops two files: the self-extracting installer archive M.B \nand the first stage installer M.T into the %TEMP% folder, then allocates another memory region, \ndecrypts, copies and executes the third stage shellcode there. \n\nThe third stage shellcode copies the first stage installer (which is a DLL library) M.T into \n%WINDOWS%\\Tasks\\n.dll, then executes by calling LoadLibrary to load it. The Windows loader \nupon loading the DLL will execute its entry code. This entry code runs the self-extracting \ninstaller archive M.B which will do the final malware installation in the system.
