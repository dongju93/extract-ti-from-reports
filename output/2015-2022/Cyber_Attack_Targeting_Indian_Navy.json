This malware can steal and send sensitive information to the\n\nattackers like keystrokes, opened applications, web browsing history, usernames/passwords, upload Desktop screen shots etc. The\n\nfeature of uploading the Desktop screen shot is notable because if the infected user opens a design or design document related to\n\nsubmarines or warships the screen shot of that can be sent to the attacker.\n\nThe attackers also hosted multiple samples of KeyBase malware in the compromised university website. Below screen shot shows\n\nhashes of 25 samples hosted on the university site.\n\nAnalysis of the Dropped Executable (doc6.exe)\n\nThe dropped \u0000le was analyzed in an isolated environment (without actually allowing it to connect to the c2 server). This section\n\ncontains the behavioral analysis of the dropped executable\n\nOnce the dropped \u0000le (doc6.exe) is executed the malware copies itself into %AllUsersPro\u0000le% directory as \u201cImportant.exe\u201d, In\n\naddition to that it also drops two \u0000les \u201cMails.txt\u201d and \u201cBrowsers.txt\u201d into the same directory as shown below.\n\nThe malware then creates a registry value for the the dropped \u0000le (Important.exe), this ensures that malware is executed every time\n\nthe system restarts.\n\nhttps://cysinfo.com/cyber-attack-targeting-indian-navys-submarine-warship-manufacturer/\n\n4/11\n\n\f2/28/2017\n\nCyber Attack Targeting Indian Navy's Submarine and Warship Manufacturer - Cysinfo\n\n\uf3ab\n\nThe malware after execution keeps track of the user activity (like applications opened, \u0000les opened etc) but does not immediately\n\ngenerate any network tra\u0000c, this is to make sure that no network activity is generated during automated/sandbox analysis. After\n\nsleeping for a long time malware makes an http connection to the C2 server (command & control server) and sends the tracked user\n\nactivity to the attacker. The below screen shot shows the communication to the C2 server on port 80.\n\nC2 Communication Pattern\n\nOnce malware makes an http connection after sleeping for a long time, it sends the system information and the tracked activity to\n\nthe C2 server as http parameters. Below screen shot shows the network communication pattern where the hostname and the\n\nmachine time is sent to C2 server.\n\nBelow screen shot shows a network communication pattern where the opened window title was sent to the C2 server, this pattern\n\nbelow indicates that \u201ctest.txt\u201d \u0000le was opened with notepad on the infected system.\n\nBelow screen shot shows a network communication pattern indicating a document named \u201csecret.docx\u201d was opened with Microsoft\n\nWord.\n\nBelow screen shot shows a network communication pattern indicating Internet Explorer was launched on the infected system.\n\nEvery activity on the infected system is sent to the attacker, this allows the attacker to take further action and also since the open\n\nwindow title is sent to attacker, this lets the attacker know about the documents opened and the tools running on the system or if\n\nany analysis tools are used to inspect the malware.\n\nhttps://cysinfo.com/cyber-attack-targeting-indian-navys-submarine-warship-manufacturer/\n\n5/11\n\n\f2/28/2017\n\nCyber Attack Targeting Indian Navy's Submarine and Warship Manufacturer - Cysinfo\n\nC2 Domain Information\n\n\uf3ab\n\nThis section contains the details of the C2 domain (tripleshop[.]id). All the 25 samples hosted on compromised university site was\n\nanalyzed and it was determined that all these samples also communicated to the C2 domain tripleshop[.]id\n\nThe C2 domain was associated with only one IP address . This IP address is associated with hosting provider in Indonesia as shown\n\nin the screen shots below\n\nBelow screen shot shows the timeline when the IP address was active. The IP was \u0000rst seen to be active on 18th Jan, 2017 (one week\n\nbefore the spear-phishing mail was sent to the victims).\n\nThreat Intelligence\n\nEven though attackers tried to make it look like the spear phishing email was sent by an email id associated with Hidrofersa but\n\ninspecting the email headers revealed some interesting information.\n\nhttps://cysinfo.com/cyber-attack-targeting-indian-navys-submarine-warship-manufacturer/\n\n6/11\n\n\f2/28/2017\n\nCyber Attack Targeting Indian Navy's Submarine and Warship Manufacturer - Cysinfo\n\nThe X-AuthUser in the header below revealed the identity of the sender. The sender is associated with a company named \u201cCombined\n\n\uf3ab\n\nFreight (PVT) Limited\u201d (combinedfreight[.]com)\n\nCombined Freight (PVT) Limited is freight forwarding company which is into ocean & air freight business headquartered in Karachi,\n\nPakistan (as per their website). This company has 4 other o\u0000ces in Pakistan (Lahore, Islamabad, Sialkot, Faisalabad). Below is the\n\nscreen shot taken from their website.\n\nBased on the information mentioned above, It looks like the spoofed email was sent by a user associated with a Pakistan based\n\ncompany Combined Freight (PVT) Limited.\n\nIndicators Of Compromise\n\nIn this case the cyber espionage group targeted Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) but it is possible that other defense\n\nequipment manufacturers could also be targeted as part of this attack campaign. The indicators associated with this attack are\n\nprovided so that the organizations (Government, Public, Private organizations, Defense and Defense equipment manufacturers) can\n\nuse these indicators to detect, remediate and investigate this attack campaign.

The following factors in this cyber attack suggests the possible involvement of Pakistan state\n\nsponsored cyber espionage group to steal the intellectual property such as design/blueprints and manufacturing data related to\n\nsubmarines and warships.\n\nVictims/targets chosen (Submarine & Warship manufacturer for Indian Navy)\n\nUse of Email theme related to the targets\n\nTiming of the spear phishing emails sent to the victims (The day before the Republic Day) \n\nEmail header information indicating the possible Pakistan connection\n\nUse of malware that is capable of spying and uploading screen shots\n\nUse of TTP\u2019s (tactics, techniques & procedures) similar to the previous campaign\n\nThe following factors reveal the attackers intention to remain stealthy and the attempt to evade sandbox analysis, manual analysis\n\nand security monitoring at both the desktop and network levels.\n\nUse of obfuscated malicious macro code\n\nUse of junk code (to divert the manual analysis)\n\nUse of compromised university site to host malicious code (to bypass security monitoring)\n\nUse of Silent UAC (user account control) bypass technique\n\nUse of Malware that sleeps for long time without generating any network activity (to evade sandbox analysis)\n\nUse of hosting provider to host C2 infrastructure\n\nCyber espionage groups will continue targeting defense sectors and defense equipment manufacturers for the following reasons:\n\nTo steal defense related information and proprietary product information that can provide their sponsoring governments with\n\nmilitary and economic advantages.\n\nTo identify vulnerabilities in the defense technologies to gain advantage over adversary\u2019s military capabilities\n\nTo reduce their research and development costs and produce and sell similar products at lower prices\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/keybase-keylogger-malware-family-exposed/\n\nhttp://www.brycampbell.co.uk/new-blog/2015/7/14/keybase-malware\n\nhttp://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/keybase-threat-grows-despite-public-takedown-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-\n\nwords/\n\nhttps://www.\u0000reeye.com/current-threats/reports-by-industry/aerospace-threat-intelligence.html\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @monnappa22 @cysinfo22\n\nhttps://cysinfo.com/cyber-attack-targeting-indian-navys-submarine-warship-manufacturer/\n\n9/11\n\n\u00a0\n\f2/28/2017\n\nCyber Attack Targeting Indian Navy's Submarine and Warship Manufacturer - Cysinfo\n\nSHARE: \n\n\uf2ab \uf536 \uf33a \uf44b\n\nMONNAPPA K A\n\n\uf536 \uf39f\n\n8 COMMENTS\n\nRAJESH A\n\nFebruary 10, 2017 at 5:46 pm\n\nThank you Monnappa. \n\nNice articulation. \n\nCyber war is really strong.
