These campaigns\nwere attributed to the BRONZE ATLAS threat group.\n\nA 2017 Microsoft complaint and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indictments unsealed\nin 2020 provide additional information on ShadowPad's connection to BRONZE ATLAS.\nThe Microsoft complaint alleges that BRONZE ATLAS (also known as Barium) deployed\nShadowPad in 2017 to steal intellectual property and personally identifiable information\n(PII). At the time, the malware was used only by BRONZE ATLAS. The DOJ indictments\nallege that Chinese nationals working for the Chengdu 404 network security company\ndeployed ShadowPad in a global campaign attributed to BRONZE ATLAS.\n\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/shadowpad-malware-analysis\n\n5/19\n\n \n \n \n\f2/16/22, 10:27 AM\n\nShadowPad Malware Analysis | Secureworks\n\nA related DOJ indictment revealed that these Chinese nationals collaborated with another\nChinese national known by the handle 'Rose' (sometimes known as Withered Rose and\nWicked Rose), using similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and sharing\nmalware. The indictment describes this individual as a sophisticated threat actor who\ncommitted computer intrusion offenses targeting high-technology organizations globally.\nCampaigns linked to Rose were tracked as Barium.\n\nA third-party report claimed that Rose likely co-developed malware with an associate\nnamed 'whg,' who has been linked to the development of the PlugX malware. PlugX is\nused by multiple Chinese threat groups. Third-party researchers also identified string and\ncode overlap between PlugX and ShadowPad. This overlap suggests close links between\nthe ShadowPad and PlugX developers. ShadowPad may have been developed by an\nindividual or group affiliated with BRONZE ATLAS. One possibility is that Chengdu 404\noriginally developed ShadowPad, as the individuals named in the DOJ indictments were\nallegedly involved with developing malware used in their campaigns.\n\nIt is likely that only BRONZE ATLAS used ShadowPad until approximately 2019. Most of\nthe ShadowPad DLL loader samples can be clustered based on compile timestamps, C2\ninfrastructure, payload versions, DLL loader code overlap, and likely victimology. CTU\nresearchers identified multiple ShadowPad clusters used in campaigns since 2019 and\nattributed these clusters to distinct threat groups. These groups include BRONZE ATLAS\nand BRONZE UNIVERSITY, whose targeting suggests affiliation with the MSS. A third-\nparty report suggests that BRONZE UNIVERSITY (referred to in the report as Earth\nLusca) may be operating near to Chengdu in China after operational security mistakes\nrevealed China-based infrastructure. Other ShadowPad clusters appear to reflect\ntargeting aligned with PLA theater command areas of responsibility.\n\nPLA reforms\n\nIn late 2015, PRC leader Xi Jinping announced widespread reforms to the PLA that\nincluded the establishment of the Strategic Support Force (PLASSF or SSF). This new\nbranch focuses on modernizing the PLA's capabilities in strategic frontiers of space,\ncyberspace, and the electromagnetic domain. The impact on the PLA's cyberespionage\nmission has been extensive. Many organizations responsible for cyberespionage and\nsignals intelligence (SIGINT) associated with the Third Department of the PLA's General\nStaff Department (commonly known as 3PLA) have been absorbed into the SSF Network\nSystems Department (NSD). The SSF NSD is also believed to be responsible for a broad\nrange of information warfare capabilities beyond cyberespionage, coordinating electronic\ncountermeasures as well as offensive and defensive cyber projects. Figure 7 shows the\nlikely SSF organizational structure.\n\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/shadowpad-malware-analysis\n\n6/19\n\n\f2/16/22, 10:27 AM\n\nShadowPad Malware Analysis | Secureworks\n\nFigure 7. PLA SSF likely organizational structure. (Source: Institute for National\nStrategic Studies)\n\nAs part of the modernization, the PLA replaced its seven military regions with five theater\ncommands: Eastern, Southern, Western, Northern, and Central (see Figure 8). These\ntheater commands orchestrate ground, naval, air, and conventional missile forces for\nmilitary operations in their geographic area of responsibility. While the exact area of\nresponsibility for each theater command is ambiguous, they are broadly responsible for\nspecific threats within their respective regions:\n\nEastern Theater Command: Taiwan strait and East China sea\nSouthern Theater Command: South China sea\nNorthern Theater Command: Russia and the Korean peninsula\nWestern Theater Command: Central Asia and the Sino-Indian border\nCentral Theater Command: defends the capital and possibly provides support to\nother theater commands\n\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/shadowpad-malware-analysis\n\n7/19\n\n \n \n\f2/16/22, 10:27 AM\n\nShadowPad Malware Analysis | Secureworks\n\nFigure 8. PLA theater command structure. (Source: The Jamestown Foundation)\n\nPrior to the PLA reforms, each military region maintained at least one Technical\nReconnaissance Bureau (TRB) to handle SIGINT and cyberespionage activities focused\non the military region's area of responsibility. The TRBs were distinct from the former\n3PLA units that were located across China, but they may have been tasked by the 3PLA.\n\nThe relationship between the TRBs and the theater commands is unclear. The TRBs may\nhave been consolidated under the SSF NSD alongside former 3PLA units. It is also\npossible that they continue to target countries in their area of responsibility but under the\ncommand and control of the SSF NSD.\n\nConnections to PLA-linked threat groups\n\nCTU researchers grouped distinct ShadowPad activity clusters by targeted geographic\nregions. Clusters align with the documented area of responsibility for three of the theater\ncommands: Northern, Southern, and Western. CTU researchers attribute some of the\nShadowPad activity to Chinese threat groups that have been publicly linked to specific\nPLA units located in the corresponding theater commands:\n\nNorthern Theater Command: CTU researchers linked ShadowPad activity to\nBRONZE HUNTLEY and BRONZE BUTLER, which are reportedly located in the\nNorthern Theater Command. These threat groups deployed ShadowPad against\ntargets in South Korea, Russia, Japan, and Mongolia. These regions align with the\nNorthern Theater Command's focus. In 2021, CTU researchers observed malware\nand infrastructure overlap between the two threat groups, suggesting close\ncollaboration.\n\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/shadowpad-malware-analysis\n\n8/19\n\n \n\f2/16/22, 10:27 AM\n\nShadowPad Malware Analysis | Secureworks\n\nWestern Theater Command: Some ShadowPad activity primarily targeted\ncountries neighboring China's western border, such as India and Afghanistan. CTU\nresearchers clustered this activity based on attacker-controlled infrastructure,\nShadowPad DLL loader variants such as ICEKILLER, and contextual information\nfrom third-party sources. Third-party researchers linked some of these campaigns\nto an individual working on behalf of the Western Theater Command. CTU analysis\ndid not reveal sufficient evidence to corroborate these claims, but the locations and\nvictimology are consistent with threat actors operating on behalf of the Western\nTheater Command.\nSouthern Theater Command: CTU researchers identified activity that used a\nspecific ShadowPad version to target organizations in the South China Sea region.\nBRONZE GENEVA is likely responsible for part of this activity based on overlap\nbetween the C2 infrastructure for the Nebulae malware family associated with\nBRONZE GENEVA and a ShadowPad sample analyzed by CTU researchers.\n\nThis attribution of ShadowPad campaigns to theater commands is based on the\nsubmitter's location for ShadowPad malware samples uploaded to the VirusTotal analysis\nservice (potentially indicating the victim's country), the C2 domain names that appear to\nreference specific regions (e.g., cloudvn. info suggests Vietnam targeting), contextual\ninformation regarding the activity and victimology, and the absence of evidence that\nShadowPad samples with the same attributes were deployed in other regions.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvidence available as of this publication suggests that ShadowPad has been deployed by\nMSS-affiliated threat groups, as well as PLA-affiliated threat groups that operate on\nbehalf of the regional theater commands. The malware was likely developed by threat\nactors affiliated with BRONZE ATLAS and then shared with MSS and PLA threat groups\naround 2019. Given the range of groups leveraging ShadowPad, all organizations that are\nlikely targets for Chinese threat groups should monitor for TTPs associated with this\nmalware. Organizations with operations in or connections to geographic regions covered\nby the regional theater commands should specifically monitor for known TTPs associated\nwith threat groups likely affiliated with the relevant theater command.\n\nThreat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 2 can be used to detect activity related to this threat.
