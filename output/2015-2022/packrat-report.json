The credentials are collected from the Windows\n\nRegistry, browser pro\ufb01les, the RAS dial up settings, Local Security Authority (LSA) settings, MS ProtectedStorage, MS IntelliForms,\u0000\n\nand the credential store.\n\nCyberGate\u2019s Functionality\n\nThe CyberGate implant runs two instances. The \ufb01rst runs in the default browser process, and acts as the monitoring component.\u0000\n\nMeanwhile, the explorer.exe instance serves as \u2018watchdog,\u2019 ensuring persistence and making sure the infector binary on disk\n\ndoesn\u2019t disappear.\n\n \n\fImage 16: Searching for indicators of an existing Spy-Net installation\n\nThe CyberGate implant comes with the same credential stealing capabilities as the infector, and is extended by routines to spy on\n\nChrome and STEAM credentials as well. Also inherited from the infector, the implant owns the same anti-analysis routine protecting\n\nit from sandboxes and debuggers.\n\nBeyond the capabilities seen in the infector, CyberGate has a range of features that provide an attacker with a full spectrum of\n\nmonitoring and remote control functionality.\n\nCyberGate capabilities include:\n\nCollecting detailed information about the infected system\nActivation and control of the webcam and microphone\nScreenshot capture\nBlocking user input (e.g. keyboard and mouse)\nControl over processes, windows, applications, devices, drive, ports, TCP & UDP connections, the clipboard, registry keys and\nvalues etc.\nControl over the \ufb01lesystem\u0000\nDownload and execution of further binaries\nEx\ufb01ltration via FTP\u0000\nCollection of information on installed security products\n\nInterestingly, CyberGate gathers information on installed security products through the Windows Management Instrumentation\n\n(WMI) by launching cscript.exe on a hardcoded .vbs-script. The script requests name and version number of installed antivirus and\n\n\ufb01rewall solutions and dumps the data to a \ufb01le:\u0000\u0000\n\nSet objSecurityCenter = GetObject(\u201cwinmgmts:.rootSecurityCenter\u201d)\nSet colFirewall = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(\u201cSelect * From FirewallProduct\u201d,,48)\nSet colAntiVirus = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(\u201cSelect * From AntiVirusProduct\u201d,,48)\nSet objFileSystem = CreateObject(\u201cScripting.\ufb01leSystemObject\u201d)\u0000\nSet objFile = objFileSystem.CreateTextFile(\u201c%FILEPATH%\u201d, True)\nEnter = Chr(13) + Chr(10)\nCountFW = 0\nCountAV = 0For Each objFirewall In colFirewall\nCountFW = CountFW + 1\nInfo = Info & \u201cF\u201d & CountFw & \u201c) \u201d & objFirewall.displayName & \u201d v\u201d & objFirewall.versionNumber &\nEnter\nNextFor Each objAntiVirus In colAntiVirus\nCountAV = CountAV + 1\nInfo = Info & \u201cA\u201d & CountAV & \u201c) \u201d & objAntiVirus.displayName & \u201d v\u201d & objAntiVirus.versionNumber &\nEnterobjFile.WriteLine(Info)\nobjFile.Close\n\nCollected data is stored in dump \ufb01les on disk and ex\ufb01ltrated to the remote server component by HTTP or FTP.\u0000\u0000\n\n3.1.2 Analysis of XTremeRAT\n\nXTremeRAT is commercial off-the-shelf malware, often available cracked, and used to monitor victim machines. While used by\n\napolitical hackers, XTremeRAT has been extensively used by government-linked malware groups to target the opposition during the\n\nongoing Syrian Civil War, as well as by other politically-motivated groups in the Middle East and North Africa. It has also been\n\nextensively analyzed, and we encourage interested readers to review some of these analyses.\n\nWhile often packed, XTreme RAT itself has limited stealth and persistence functionality. Its monitoring capabilities are also\n\nstraightforward. The versions we analyze here have no code obfuscation. XTreme Rat is implemented as client/server architecture,\n\nwhere the infected machine acts as server, while the C&C component is the client.\n\nThis version of Xtreme Rat\u2019s capabilities include:\n\n\fLogging keystrokes\nLogging the name of the foreground desktop application\nSnif\ufb01ng the clipboard for passwords\u0000\nDownloading and executing binaries via HTTP, presumably to install second stage malware\n\nImage 17: Installation of the XTreme RAT keylogger module\n\nXtreme RAT operation and keylogging functionality\n\nThe Xtreme RAT implant sniffs the clipboard contents via the keylogger window, using a clipboard viewer that it also installs. The\n\nviewer receives the window message WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD every time the clipboard changes, and provides access to Clipboard\n\ncontents. Clipboard and keylogger data is dumped to a .dat-\ufb01le that, along with the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le (.cfg), is located in the\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\n[\u2026]\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows folder for the current user. Both \ufb01lenames are dictated by XTreme RAT\u2019s con\ufb01guration.\u0000\u0000\n\nXTreme RAT data \ufb01les\u0000\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows\\RJokLSZBj.cfg\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows\\RJokLSZBj.dat\n\nThe dump \ufb01le is ex\ufb01ltrated via push to FTP. XTreme RAT comes with precon\ufb01gured FTP server credential placeholders\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\n(ftpuser/ftppass) to log on to ftp.ftpserver.com, which are then switched for updated values received from the C&C at runtime.\n\nThe XTreme RAT implant also creates a mutex named following the same naming scheme as con\ufb01guration and dump \ufb01le (e.g.\u0000\u0000\n\n\u201cRJokLSZBjPERSIST\u201d). The RAT\u2019s con\ufb01guration is fetched from the .rsrc-section and encrypted using RC4, with the key \u201cCONFIG\u201d.\u0000\n\nThe same algorithm and key combination has been seen in use before in other variants of XTreme RAT.\n\nThis variant of XTreme RAT uses explorer.exe as a container for remote threads to carry out speci\ufb01c functions. Thread injection can\u0000\n\nhappen on at least three occasions.\n\nPossible injections of explorer.exe by XTreme RAT:\n\nA \u2018watchdog\u2019 thread  to restore persistence keys, and to locate and run the infector binary. To increase stealth, the dropping\n\nmodule changes the timestamp of the dropped infector.\n\nA thread for deleting of XTreme RAT\u2019s \ufb01les on disk\u0000\n\nThe entire keylogging code and FTP push functionality\n\n3.2: 2014- 2015 AlienSpy Dominates\n\nOver the past two years, Packrat has been using an evolving family of off-the-shelf malware known as AlienSpy. The software\n\nbegan as the free RAT \u201cFrutas,\u201d and was identi\ufb01ed in 2013\u0000 during a campaign in Mexico. This was subsequently adapted for\n\ncommercial sale as the \u201cPremium RAT\u201d Adwind. Adwind could be purchased for $75 for a single license, and up to $250 for multiple\n\nlicenses. Then, by 2013, AdWind was renamed UNRECOM (UNiversal REmote COntrol Multi-platform), and was detected in\n\ntargeted attacks in the Middle East.\n\nThe software was most recently branded \u201cAlienSpy,\u201d and was again found by security researchers in targeted spying operations. At\n\nthe time of this report, the latest re-packaging of this RAT is known as JSocket. For the purposes of this report, we\u2019ll refer to all\n\nvariants of this spyware as \u201cAlienSpy.\u201d AlienSpy is a relatively full-featured RAT with a range of features, such as recording the\n\nvictim\u2019s keystrokes, audio eavesdropping via a device\u2019s built-in microphone, remote viewing of the desktop, and the ability to turn on\n\na victim\u2019s webcam \u201cwithout user noti\ufb01cation.\u201d Alienspy has been extensively analyzed by malware researchers, including reports by\u0000\n\nProofPoint and Fidelis.\n\n3.2.1 Packrat\u2019s Alienspy Deployment\n\n \n\fFrom 2014 to early 2015, Packrat\u2019s preferred technique was to send AlienSpy implants as attachments in phishing emails with the\n\nextension \u2018.pdf.jar.\u2019 The default setting in Windows is to hide \ufb01le extensions, thus making it appear to be a \u201c.pdf\u201d \ufb01le. With some\u0000\u0000\n\nminor differences, all the samples from this time period are built in a similar manner. There\u2019s an outer .jar (Java archive) \ufb01le\u0000\n\ncontaining a folder named META-INF and two \ufb01les: Favicon.ico and Principal.class. Upon execution, Principal.class unzips the\u0000\n\ncontents of \u201cFavicon.ico\u201d (not an icon \ufb01le, but a .zip archive), and looks for a \ufb01lename containing \u201c.jar\u201d.\u0000\u0000\n\nContents of Favicon.ico\n\n0doc.jar\n1Estrictamente Secreto y Con\ufb01dencial.pdf\u0000\n\nOnce it \ufb01nds the right \ufb01le (in this case 0doc.jar), it drops it to a randomly-named temp \ufb01le starting with a constant string and invokes\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\nJava to run it.\n\nInside the .jar \ufb01le from \u201cFavicon.ico\u201d\u0000\n\nMETA-INF/MANIFEST.MF\nMANIFEST.MF\nID\nplugins/Server.class\nMain.class\nEstrictamente Secreto y Con\ufb01dencial.pdf\u0000\n\n\u201cMain.class\u201d is obfuscated using Allatori, a Russian-origin JVM obfuscator used by AlienSpy.\n\nThis reads part of an RC4 key from the \ufb01le \u201cID.\u201d To this it appends a constant string, then uses the full RC4 key to decrypt the\u0000\n\ncontents of MANIFEST.MF, which yields the actual Adwind implant JAR \ufb01le. Others have written about the operation and\u0000\n\ndeobfuscation of Allatori, including how to deobfuscate it, here, here, and here.\n\nAlienSpy in MS Of\ufb01ce Documents\u0000\n\nIn 2015, Packrat started sending AlienSpy implants embedded in .docx \ufb01les. The method used to obfuscate these \ufb01les is more\u0000\u0000\n\ncomplex, but ultimately similar to previous techniques. Uncompressing an infected MS Word document reveals a \ufb01le named\u0000\n\n\u201coleObject1.bin\u201d under the directories word/embeddings. Opening this \ufb01le, which is a jar, reveals:\u0000\n\na\nabcdefghijka.class\nabcdefghijkf.class\nabcdefghijkj.class\nabcdefghijks.class\nabcdefghijku.class\nabcdefghijkz.class\na.txt\nb.txt\nc.dat\nkjmhs\nMain.class\nMETA-INF\n\nSimilar to the obfuscation described above in Packrat\u2019s earlier uses of AlienSpy, half the decryption key is in a.txt. The other half is a\n\nstring which is decrypted iteratively by the abcdefghijk[a,f,j,s,u,z].class \ufb01les with the method and class names from the caller.\u0000\n\nPersistence is achieved by adding the following registry value:\n\n\u201creg.exe\u201d (Access type: \u201cSETVAL\u201d, Path: \u201c\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS\\CURRENTVERSION\\RUN\u201d,\nKey: \u201cJAVASE\u201d, Value: \u201c\u201dC:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\RoUndCuBe\\bin\\javaw.exe\u201d -jar\n\u201cC:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas934FlashJava.\n\n3.2.2 Adzok makes an appearance\n\nBetween 2014-2015, Packrat also used Adzok \u2013 Invisible Remote Administrator. Similar to AlienSpy in functionality, the java-based\n\nAdzok is apparently from Bolivia. The premium version costs $990, but it appears that Packrat is using the \u201cfree\u201d version. This\n\nversion of Adzok does not use obfuscation, which makes it possible to simply uncompress the jar \ufb01les within the docx and read the\u0000\n\nclear-text con\ufb01guration \ufb01le. Given the obfuscated nature of the other RATs that Packrat has used, their use of Adzok is surprising. It\u0000\u0000\n\nis possible that they were having stability, compatibility, or detection problems with other RATs and that Adzok served a speci\ufb01c\u0000\n\nrequirement.\n\n\f4. Packrat\u2019s Persistent Phishing Campaigns\n\nPackrat is active in phishing, often against the same groups and individuals whom they target with malware. For example, when\n\nexamining one target of malware attacks, we found this individual had been targeted by dozens of phishing attempts by Packrat\n\nduring the same period. The same domains and fake identities that Packrat uses to seed malware are also used to serve phishing,\n\nalthough Packrat also maintains dedicated phishing sites and servers. While phishing e-mails appeared to be regularly sent, we also\n\nobserved particular cases of the phishing apparently sent to targets in response to contacts they made during our investigation.\n\nWe have been able to achieve the most systematic visibility of Packrat\u2019s campaign against Ecuadorian targets, but have found\n\nevidence of targeting in neighboring countries including Venezuela. Packrat uses both e-mails and social media messages, as well\n\nas SMSes to send phishing messages.\n\nThis section describes these phishing campaigns, and describes both Politically-Themed and Non-Politically Themed phishing\n\nattacks.\n\nCategory\n\nExample Domain\n\nNote\n\nPolitics & News\n\nlavozamericana.info\n\nFake news website\n\nGovernmental \u2013 Ecuador\n\nPolitical Movement \u2013\n\nEcuador\n\nasambleanacional-gob-\n\nLookalike to the Ecuadorian National Assembly\u2019s e-\n\nec.cu9.co\n\nmail login\n\nmovimientoanticorreista.com Fake political movement\n\nFree E-mail\n\nmgoogle.us\n\nFake Google login\n\n4.1 Non-Politically Themed Phishing Content\n\nOne of the most common phishing techniques is lookalike communications from popular webmail and social media sites containing\n\nrequests for password veri\ufb01cation, noti\ufb01cations of unauthorized logins, and so on. Packrat uses a wide range of templates for the\u0000\u0000\n\nmajor email providers, including Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail. A majority of the e-mails are in Spanish. The messages are typically\n\npersonalized to the targets, including both their names and e-mail addresses.\n\nImage 18: Example phishing email\n\nTranslated Message\n\nFrom: Gmail Team no.response.delivery.es@gmail.com\nSubject: [Victim Name], you have a pending warning !\nTo: [victim email]\n\n[Victim email],\n\n[Victim Name]for security reasons we request that you verify your account below.\n\nTo ensure proper use of your account, we request that you verify it.\n\nClick here to verify your account.\n\n \n\fDepending on the attack, the phishing either contains a direct link to the phishing URL, or uses a shortener.\n\n4.1.1 Most Recent Non-Political Phishing\n\nRecently, the attackers appear to have slightly varied their technique. We have observed them making extensive use of tinyurl as a\n\nshortener, as well as moving their phishing pages to the free host cu9.co. The attackers may have concluded that using a free\n\nprovider reduced costs and increased \ufb02exibility.\u0000\n\nExample recent phishing URL and shortener:\n\ntinyurl.com/nww83ov Yields: main-latam-soporte-widget-local.cu9[dot]co\n\n4.1.2 Example Non-Political Phishing SMSes\n\nA number of Packrat\u2019s targets also received phishing SMSes. The SMSes often use similar language to the phishing e-mails, and in\n\nsome cases use the same shortened URL. In other cases, the attackers push harder, warning the targeted user that their accounts\n\nwill be terminated if they fail to follow the link. In at least one case we observed that the messages contained improperly formatted\n\ne-mail addresses.\n\n4.2 Politically Themed Phishing\n\nImage 19: Example of non political phishing\n\nWe observed a wide range of e-mails and messages that contained content with political overtones. Packrat takes two basic\n\napproaches in the attacks we have examined. First approach: create fake political and media organizations. Second approach:\n\nimpersonate well-known groups and high-pro\ufb01le individuals\u0000. Attacks typically took the form of messages and e-mails\n\ncontaining information either in \u2018solidarity,\u2019 upsetting information, or other relevant news. A majority of what we observed seemed to\n\nbe crafted to appeal to opposition elements.\n\nWhile much of the phishing seems to mimic common free webmail and social media sites, in speci\ufb01c cases, Packrat mimicked e-\u0000\n\nmail services of high-pro\ufb01le targets, like the Ecuadorian National Assembly.\u0000\n\n4.2.1 Targeting Ecuadorian Parliamentarians\n\nA group we believe to be Packrat has operated a phishing campaign that mimics the Ecuadorian national assembly\u2019s webmail\n\nportal. This malicious site prompts the target(s) to enter their email credentials, which are captured via formmail, a technique seen\n\nrepeatedly in the phishing pages we identi\ufb01ed (see below).\u0000\n\nasambleanacional-gob-ec.cu9.co\n\nThe legitimate domain is:\n\n\fhttp://mail.asambleanacional.gob.ec/\n\n4.2.2 A Typical Credential Harvesting Page\n\nWhatever the bait, the links on the messages typically lead victims (often via a shortener) to a lookalike domain for a free email\n\nprovider. During the summer of 2015, a frequently observed domain was a lookalike for Google, although there have been many\n\nothers:\n\nmgoogle.us\n\nWhile the attacks were active, mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login.\n\nImage 20: mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login\n\nOnce a victim\u2019s credentials are entered, they are shown a Spanish language note \u201ccon\ufb01rming\u201d that their gmail has been \u201cunblocked\u201d\u0000\n\nand thanking the victim for \u201cchoosing us.\u201d\n\nImage 21: A Spanish language note \u201ccon\ufb01rming\u201d that their Gmail has been\u0000\n\n\u201cunblocked\u201d\n\nIn other cases, Packrat sends \u201ccon\ufb01rmation\u201d emails to the original victim, congratulating them on \u201csuccessfully\u201d verifying their\u0000\n\naccount after credentials are entered. In speci\ufb01c cases, we found that this e-mail arrived several hours before phished accounts\u0000\n\nwere accessed.\n\nWhile the phishing has used different tools to harvest credentials, we \ufb01nd that Packrat makes repeated use of the legitimate online\u0000\n\nwebsite form service formmail.com to receive phished credentials. Formmail is a legitimate HTML-based form processor that\n\nreceives the contents of data entered into forms, then sends them to an e-mail address.\n\n\f4.3 A Sample of Phishing & Malware Seeding Sites\n\nThe attackers control a range of domains that they use to serve both phishing and malware. This section outlines elements of this\n\ninfrastructure. A more complete list is in Appendix D, but we describe certain domains of interest here. The phishing page\n\nmgoogle.us, for example, has resolved to a range of IPs, including:\n\nIP\n\nFirst Seen\n\nLast Seen\n\nWHOIS\n\n198.12.150.249\n\n5/19/2015 6:16:00\n\n9/4/2015 9:51:00\n\n50.63.202.57\n\n9/4/2015 12:52:00\n\n10/8/2015 21:44:00\n\nGodaddy\n\nGodaddy\n\nOf these IPs, the \ufb01rst (198.12.150.249) is particularly interesting. We \ufb01nd that the same IP was used to host a range of other\u0000\u0000\n\nsuspect domains with similar themes. For a full list of associated domains, see Appendix D. While some of these domains are\n\nlookalikes for logins, or update pages (e.g. sopporte-gmail.com or login-of\ufb01ce365.com) others seem to have a more political angle.\u0000\n\nWHOIS\n\nName Pedro Luis\nOrganization Reterg is\nAddress teredotr\nCity berlin\nState berlin\nCountry DE Germany\nPhone +49.454545445\nPrivate no\n\nThe registrant of the site is enripintos123@outlook.es, whom we \ufb01nd listed as the registrant for a range of other domains. All but two\u0000\n\nare lookalike to the login pages of major online services, or suggestive of updates to services like Java and Android (see Appendix\n\nD). The two exceptions are lavozamericana.info and pancaliente.info (see Section 6. Possible Deception Operations). Both of\n\nthose domains were registered within the timeframe of other registrations of lookalike or con\ufb01rmed phishing domains.\u0000\n\n4.3.1 Lookalike Fake News Sites\n\nThe website Ecuador En Vivio (ecuadorenvivo.com) is a legitimate news site, however the attackers control the lookalike\n\necuadorenvivo.co domain. Packrat has used this fake domain to send emails to targets, either containing attachment-based\n\nmalware, or links to the site which has also been used to seed malware via a plugin error.\n\nA Twitter user spotted the fake plugin noti\ufb01cation in May 2015 and alerted their followers, and included a screenshot purporting to\u0000\n\nshow one of the fake plugin alerts.\n\nImage 22: Fake plugin noti\ufb01cation\u0000\n\n\fSimilarly, Focus Ecuador (focusecuador.net) is a genuine news website, however the domain focusecuador.tk, is controlled by the\n\nattackers, and has been observed seeding malware using a fake popup. Examination of the IP hosting focusecuador.tk\n\n(193.105.134.27) reveals a long list of obvious lookalike domains (See Appendix D).\n\n4.3.2 A Fake News Organization: The American Voice?\n\nA second interesting domain is lavozamericana.info, which is no longer active. However we were also able to \ufb01nd a Twitter identity\u0000\n\nand string of tweets suggesting that there may have been an effort to establish the legitimacy of the site.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/voz_americana\n\nInterestingly, the fake identity appears to have had at least some success, as some of the followers of the account appear to be\n\ngenuine. While the site is no longer active, Google\u2019s cache indicates that a phishing page was hosted on the site.\n\nImage 23: Google\u2019s cache indicates that a phishing page was hosted on the site\n\nWhile we have received reports that individuals targeted by Packrat lost access to their iCloud accounts during the timeframe of this\n\nattack, we have been unable to verify conclusively whether Packrat was responsible.\n\n4.3.3 A Fake Opposition Movement\n\nA number of the targets we identi\ufb01ed had received e-mails and messages purporting to come from movimientoanticorreista.com,\u0000\n\nincluding the example Attack 1 above. The same domain was also mentioned in a recent report by an Ecuadorian NGO of malware\n\nattacks against journalists in Ecuador. We found malware seeding messages associated with this domain, typically sent by\n\nmovimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com.\n\nAnother Anti Correa Movement E-mail\n\nDe: Movimiento Anti Correista <movimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com>\nFecha: [REDACTED: April 2015]\nAsunto: DOCUMENTOS FILTRADOS DEL GOBIERNO CORREISTA \u2013 EL SILLON MILLONARIO Y LAS ACTIVIDADES CORRUPTAS\nPara: [REDACTED]SALUDOS ESTIMADO,Compartimos con usted nuestro nuevo sitio web en el cual estaremos publicando informaci\u00f3n\ndel corrupto gobierno de Rafael Correa.DESCARGUE LOS DOCUMENTOS DE:www.movimientoanticorreista.com\n\nTranslated E-mail\n\nFrom: Anti Correa Movement <movimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com>\nSubject: LEAKED DOCUMENTS FROM THE CORREISTA GOVERNMENT \u2013 THE ARMCHAIR MILLIONAIRE AND CORRUPT\nACTIVITIES\nTo: [REDACTED]ESTEEMED GREETINGS,We are sharing with you our new website where we will publish information about the corrupt\ngovernment of Rafael Correa.DOWNLOAD DOCUMENTS:www.movimientoanticorreista.com\n\n\f4.4 A Window Into Campaign Scope\n\nSeveral moves by Packrat gave us access to some more systematic information about the scope of their attacks. During much of\n\n2015, we observed that Packrat regularly used the same bit.ly link in a range of attacks.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1wl3YE2\n\nThis link was created Oct. 31, 2014 by an anonymous sharer. Examining statistics for the bit.ly link, we were able to see a super\ufb01cial\u0000\n\noverview of the volume, timeframe, and basic geographic distribution of clicks.\n\nImage 25: An overview of the volume, timeframe, and basic geographic distribution of clicks\n\nThe distribution of clicks is particularly interesting, and suggests that a majority of the hits were located in Ecuador, with others in\n\nArgentina, Germany, the United States, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The absence of Brazil is not necessarily surprising, as it is\n\nlikely that the attackers, if they continue to phish in Brazil, may be using separate, Portuguese language sites. This provides an\n\nindirect window into the location of Packrat\u2019s targets.\n\nA majority of clicks (322) came from direct link clicks, rather than link shares elsewhere. While this particular bitly link was not\n\nextensively clicked on social media sites, Packrat does use social media for some seeding.\n\n4.5 Note: Lots of Phishing, Not All of it Linkable\n\nThe investigation yielded a high volume of  Spanish-language phishing attacks against the same individuals that Packrat targeted,\n\nhowever for a number of reasons we were unable to link much of the phishing activity to Packrat.  One of the most notable and high\n\nvolume campaigns that we identi\ufb01ed used the domain \u0000gmail.com.msg07.xyz and masqueraded  as a range of account noti\ufb01cations\u0000\n\nfrom popular providers including Gmail.  Typically these messages displayed as originating from e-mail addresses like \u201cno-\n\nresponder@supportgmai1.com.\u201d   In some cases, individuals received these messages almost weekly over long periods of time.\n\n5. Possible Deception Operations\n\nNot all of the domains associated with this group appear to have been built to spread malware, or to trick victims into entering their\n\npasswords. Several domains are extensively built out, and currently maintained, which appear to be designed to convey the\n\nimpression of active, news media sites. Some of these sites contain \u2018original\u2019 news stories and \u2018leaks\u2019 about political \ufb01gures. At least\u0000\n\ntwo of these sites seem Venezuela-speci\ufb01c, while a third is Ecuador-oriented.\u0000\n\nWhat makes these three fake organizations exceptionally interesting is that we have found no evidence that they are used to seed\n\n\fmalware or conduct phishing, either directly, or as pretexts for messages. While it may be that we simply lack visibility on the\n\ntargeting, it may be that the pages and identities serve another function. They may be attempts to seed false information, or might\n\nserve as watering holes to attract individuals that Packrat or its sponsors wish to monitor. They may also be coupled with other\n\noperations on which we have no visibility.\n\n5.1 Anti-Chavez: The Very Strange Case of pancaliente.info\n\nUpdate: immediately prior to the publication of this report the Pancaliente.info site went of\ufb02ine.  The site is \u0000still viewable in\n\nGoogle\u2019s cache.  The second domain of this type (chavistas24.com) remains online.\n\nOne of the most interesting domains also hosted on 198.12.150.249 is pancaliente.info. At \ufb01rst glance this is a Venezuela-focused\u0000\n\nnews and information site. Unlike all of the other sites hosted on this IP that we could verify, this site appeared to have a large\n\nvolume of original content that was presented in a news format.\n\nNevertheless, the site has many links to the other domains. While the domain registration is currently masked, the registration e-\n\nmail is shared with other phishing sites.\n\npancaliente.info\n\nGoDaddy.com,LLC(R171-\n\nLRMS)\n\nenripintos123@outlook.es ns1.hostinger.ru 10/25/2014 49454545445\n\nThe registration can be veri\ufb01ed\u0000, although pancaliente.info\u2019s WHOIS has since been made private.\n\nImage 26: Pan caliente website as it appeared in October 2015\n\nExamining more closely, much of the content seems to be intended to appeal to Venezuelans at home and abroad who oppose the\n\nPartido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV: the party of Hugo Chavez). Some of the reports are intriguing because they describe\n\nprivate documents seemingly obtained by the site (and of questionable veracity), but without further information about their origins.\n\nIn other cases, the site has published purportedly \u201cleaked\u201d documents. Many of these stories are critical of individuals linked to the\n\nPSUV. Many reports also concern the \u201cExpat\u201d community of Venezuelans who oppose the regime from overseas, especially the\n\ndiaspora in Spain.\n\nPanCaliente is referenced elsewhere online, such as an apparently leaked document hosted on Slideshare. Some of their reports\n\nalso appear to have been excerpted or cited by other online news sites.\n\nAlthough there seems to be a great deal of content, PanCaliente\u2019s articles do not have bylines. While the site is linked with a very\n\n \n\factive Twitter account (https://twitter.com/pancalienteve), the associated Facebook pro\ufb01le (facebook.com/pancalienteok) is sparse.\u0000\n\nThe WayBack Machine makes it clear that PanCaliente has only recently become active.\n\nImage 27: The Wayback Machine on Pan caliente\n\nInterestingly, some of the \ufb01rst reports published on the site appear to have been written when the site was being demoed as having\u0000\n\na different name and identity \u201cVenezuela365.com.\u201d\n\nImage 28: Early logos, still visible in the website\u2019s directory structure\n\nImage 29: Variation on the current PanCaliente logo\n\n \n \n\fThe many images of this alternate logo as it went through its iterations are publicly visible. Also still online is at least one report that\n\nstill refers to the site as venezuela365. Interestingly, that \ufb01rst \u2018report\u2019 refers to \u201csecret\u201d information, including reproducing a purported\u0000\n\ncheque, without explaining its provenance.\n\nhttp://pancaliente[.]info/los-negocios-secretos-de-leocenis-garcia-y-gonzalo-tirado/\n\n\u201cGarc\u00eda demand\u00f3 a Tirado en un corte de Miami cuando el empresario le dio al periodista un cheque falso al cual Venezuela365\n\ntuvo acceso.\u201d\n\nThe source of this page also contains links to the now-defunct venezuela365.com\n\n\u201chttp://venezuela365.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tirado-g-300\u00d7169.jpg\u201c\n\nAn identically named image is now hosted on pancaliente.info, in an identical directory.\n\nThe venezuela365.com domain was registered behind DomainsByProxy, however previous WHOIS names Sistekon Corp as a prior\n\nregistrant. Sistekon Corporation seems to now be defunct, although its information is still on archive.org, and indicates that it\n\ndevelops IT software as well as selling various security solutions. Given that the domain expired in 2013, but was re-registered in\n\n2014 at around the same time as pancaliente.info, the link may be coincidental.\n\nWe found no evidence that PanCaliente or venezuela365 was ever used to seed malware or conduct phishing attempts, either\n\ndirectly, or as a pretext for malicious content.\n\n5.2 And Pro-Chavez: Chavistas 24.com\n\nThe domain, chavistas24.com, which seems to refer to supporters of former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, also has a range\n\nof content that is apparently supportive of the party.\n\nImage 30: Screenshot of Chavistas24.com showing articles tagged \u201cTraitors of the Revolution\u201don Chavistas24.com\n\nChavistas24.com similarly has an associated Twitter account that pushes out tweets, mostly referencing stories published on the\n\nwebsite.\n\n \n\f https://twitter.com/chavistas24/\n\nWe found no evidence that chavistas24.com was used to phish or send malware, either directly, or as a pretext for malicious content\n\nImage 31: The Chavistas 24 Twitter Feed\n\nor messages.\n\n5.3 Seeking Angry Police?\n\nPackrat appears to be interested in attracting dissatis\ufb01ed members of Ecuador\u2019s National Police, and has created a website\u0000\n\n(justicia-desvinculados.com) and social media identity built around \u201cLos Desvinculados,\u201d referring to police let go from Ecuador\u2019s\n\nNational Police, possibly in the context of corruption inquiries. The website, which also includes a login section, contains news and\n\nhighly critical reports about the Ecuadorian government.\n\nEcuador\u2019s police have previously been involved in protests over bene\ufb01t cuts that some have seen as one of the strongest threats to\u0000\n\nEcuadorian President Rafael Correa\u2019s rule.\n\nImage 32: Screenshot of Los Desvinculados website\n\n \n\fThe social media component of this creation, including a Twitter page of the same name (twitter.com/justdesvincula2) further\n\ndevelops the identity.\n\nAs with the two other operations described in this section, we have been unable to identify malware or phishing associated directly\n\nImage 33: Screenshot of Desvinculados Twitter page\n\nor indirectly with Justicia Desvinculados.\n\nPart 6: The Challenge of Attribution\n\nThe evidence presented in this report points to a coordinated and persistent campaign with a regional focus. Naturally, this raises\n\nquestions about attribution. This section assesses two competing hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State-Sponsored and\n\nHypothesis 2: Packrat is Not State-Sponsored. For each hypothesis we provide one or more scenarios that we consider\n\nplausible versions of the hypothesis.\n\n6.1 Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State-Sponsored\n\n6.1.2 Examining the Target List\n\nThe list of known targets is full of in\ufb02uential people whose activities could have an impact on the domestic and regional political\u0000\n\nstanding of regimes in several countries. Where we have been able to identify individuals who have been targeted, we \ufb01nd vocal,\u0000\n\nstrong regime critics and independent journalists in Ecuador and Argentina. Interestingly, Packrat has also targeted\n\nparliamentarians, and others within the government of Ecuador. This diversity of targets with (possibly) opposing positions is a\n\ncommon theme in the data.\n\nIn other cases, we \ufb01nd phishing and malware-seeding websites, emails and messages with obviously political themes. Packrat\u0000\n\ncreated fake political organizations, whose identities, logos, and websites are then used to seed phishing attacks and malware.\n\n\fThese materials seem designed to appeal primarily to both critics and (some) members of governments in Ecuador and Venezuela.\n\nWe also believe that there are targets in other countries, including Brazil, but have limited information about who they are.\n\nThese are the kinds of targets who would be of interest to an intelligence or security service in the region, especially one not\n\nequipped to directly and passively monitor all of the communications of their targets. The multiple nations re\ufb02ected in the seeding\u0000\n\nand targeting suggest, further, that the sponsor(s) of this activity would be interested in the opponents of several regimes.\n\n6.1.3 Motivation for Disinformation Campaigns\n\nWe see a range of fake websites touching on political themes, but not obviously used to seed malware. While some of these sites\n\nshare the same registrations as malware serving sites, they differ by having extensive content, and show no evidence of having\n\nhosted malicious \ufb01les or phishing pages, or of having been used as pretexts for campaigns, as is common with Packrat. The content\u0000\n\nre\ufb02ects extensive effort, as does the backstopping with identities on social media sites.\u0000\n\nThere seem to be three possible explanations for these pages. First, the pages may be an attempt to create credible fake\n\norganizations that can be used to actively promote disinformation, interspersed with real news. Second, the pages may serve as\n\nhoneypots, used to attract targets, either to identify and possibly manipulate them, or to build trust that could then be used in\n\nmalware attacks. Finally, the pages may be part of information gathering operations that have other components of which we are not\n\naware.\n\nWhile it would not be surprising for a political movement or well-funded set of interests to engage in these activities in one country,\n\nPackrat has done so in multiple countries. It is not clear what group beyond a state, would be interested in this kind of activity, and\n\nhave the resources to support it.\n\n6.1.4 Ability to Pay\n\nThe hosting and domain registrations necessary to maintain this campaign infrastructure for more than seven years clearly have\n\nassociated costs. The human labor associated with creating and maintaining the many fake websites we have observed is also\n\ncostly. This is especially true for the websites with substantial \u201coriginal\u201d content, such as PanCaliente. Finally, the extensive and\n\npersonalized targeting clearly re\ufb02ects substantial human effort.\u0000\n\nThe cost of this campaign suggests that Packrat is either well-resourced, or has sponsors who can pay for server space and time,\n\nas well as the costs of Packrat\u2019s operators. We see no evidence of targeting with out-of-scope seeding materials, such as industry,\n\nbusiness or the \ufb01nancial sector. Given the cost of the campaign, it is dif\ufb01cult to see who, beyond a state or an organized entity with\u0000\u0000\n\npolitical aspirations, would both want the information, and be in a position to pay for it.\n\n6.1.5 Clues That Packrat Feels \u2018Safe\u2019\n\nWhen the \ufb01rst reports were published on the Nisman and Argentine targeting in early 2015, some of Packrat\u2019s infrastructure was\u0000\n\nexposed. Nevertheless, much of the infrastructure has remained online. From a pragmatic point of view this makes sense. If Packrat\n\nhad successful implants operational at that time, taking the infrastructure of\ufb02ine would close that access. Packrat would have had to\u0000\n\nengage in a process of pushing out updated implants to the infected computers that connected to a new host. This time-consuming\n\nprocess would also be prone to failure and possible detection.\n\nIf Packrat were afraid of criminal punishment in their country of residence, it would have been natural to take the servers of\ufb02ine once\u0000\n\nexposed. Their interlinked infrastructure can be used to investigate, as we did, the broader structure of their campaigns. In the\n\nhands of a law enforcement agency, these active servers could potentially be traced back to the responsible parties.\n\nThe fact that the servers remain online suggests that Packrat is operating purely on practical concerns, which do not include fear of\n\nthe authorities. We take this to suggest that they may enjoy a degree of protection in the country or countries in which they operate.\n\nWhile it is less conclusive, their taunts of a Citizen Lab researcher also suggest a degree of con\ufb01dence that these actions will not\u0000\n\nhave consequence for them. Given their decision to keep their infrastructure online, this researcher may not have been the \ufb01rst (or\u0000\n\nthe last) to bother them by analyzing one of their attacks.\n\n6.1.6 Two Scenarios of State Sponsorship\n\nIn this section we present two possible scenarios for state sponsorship. The data we have presented in this report could be\n\nexplained by either of these possibilities (or by the scenario outlined for Hypothesis 2: Non State Sponsor).\n\nScenario 1: A Single State Sponsor\n\nThere are several possible explanations for the targeting we see. It is possible that Packrat is working for a single intelligence or\n\nsecurity service, and that these activities all re\ufb02ect that service\u2019s targeting. Such a service would, potentially, wish to keep tabs on\u0000\n\nmany groups, including both its opponents, the opponents of friendly governments, and possibly friendly governments themselves.\n\nThe strong representation of ALBA (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas) countries, and their recent \u201cfellow-travelers\u201d (Argentina\n\nincluded, although it has recently changed ruling parties), among the locations of targeting may be instructive. The leaders of these\n\ncountries are widely seen as political allies on the leftist spectrum, although Argentina\u2019s most recent election in November 2015\n\n\felected a president who seems to reject this relationship. The governments of Ecuador and Venezuela, meanwhile, are especially\n\nclose allies, although it is unclear how this will evolve given Venezuela\u2019s very recent elections.\n\nSome may jump to interpret public reports of malware attacks targeting opponents of the Ecuadorian government as conclusive\n\nevidence of of\ufb01cial Ecuadorian government involvement with Packrat. They may also point to previous reports that Ecuador\u2019s\u0000\n\ndomestic intelligence agency reportedly used the commercial trojan made by Hacking Team to target at least one dissident.\n\nHowever, the presence of targets within the Ecuadorian parliament and possibly elsewhere in the government challenges any\n\nsimplistic theory of Ecuadorian government sponsorship, but does not completely rule it out as intra-governmental rivalries or\n\nother dynamics could be at play.\n\nScenario 2: Mercenary Work for One or More Government Sponsors\n\nThe range and diversity of regional targets, which includes the opponents of several regimes, as well as those same governments\n\nsupporters in some cases, could be taken as indicating that the threat actor group is reusing the same infrastructure for campaigns\n\non behalf of multiple client governments at once. It is possible, for example, that Packrat is in the \u201caddress book\u201d of multiple clients,\n\nand reuses the same infrastructure for multiple campaigns.\n\n6.2 Hypothesis 2: Packrat is Not a State Actor\n\nAlthough some of the evidence we have outlined above provides circumstantial support for state sponsorship, other features of\n\nPackrat\u2019s activity are not so clear. This section brie\ufb02y lays out the most salient of these pieces of evidence: lack of technical\u0000\n\nsophistication. We evaluate this fact, and then brie\ufb02y note a potential scenario for non-state sponsorship.\u0000\n\n6.2.1 Lack of Use of technically sophisticated tools\n\nThe malware used by this campaign is primarily Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RATs, not boutique or tailor-made implants. Nor\n\nis it the commercial malware sold to governments by companies like FinFisher and Hacking Team. Additionally, the attackers do not\n\nmake use of exploits for their malware seeding. The lack of exploits very likely hampers the ef\ufb01cacy of many attacks. For example\u0000\n\nsome of the bait documents instruct victims to double click on an icon in the document. This is cumbersome, and is more likely to\n\nresult in failed attacks or discovery. A threat actor with the direct support of a government might have access to more sophisticated\n\nmalware, and exploits.\n\nHowever, it is well documented that not all government-linked malware groups make use of sophisticated malware or exploits. Prior\n\nresearch by Citizen Lab, for example, has shown that state-sponsored groups targeting civil society often use the minimum\n\nnecessary technical sophistication in their campaigns. Why use more sophisticated or esoteric technique when simpler tools\n\nsuf\ufb01ce? Other research on government-linked hacking groups in the Middle East also suggests that these groups persist in exploit-\u0000\n\nless targeting, perhaps because it is inexpensive, and that it nevertheless achieves a minimum satisfactory level of infections.\n\nUltimately, the reliance on COTS malware and lack of exploits does not enable us to draw many conclusions. However, it does have\n\none feature worth noting: by extensively obfuscating COTS malware, the attackers are nevertheless able to deliver malware that is\n\neffective at evading detection while simultaneously being dif\ufb01cult to attribute. That said, since obfuscated malware is also common\u0000\n\nin criminal hacking, the pairing of crimeware and obfuscators does not tell either way towards this hypothesis.\n\n6.2.2: Scenario: Non-State Group\n\nIt is impossible to reject the possibility that Packrat is a criminal or non-state group. Such a group could, in theory, be a supporter of\n\nan opposition political movement, or have other interests in the critics of regimes. There are a range of powerful non-state groups in\n\nSouth America, including cartels and others involved in illegal traf\ufb01cking, who would certainly have the ability to pay for these\u0000\n\noperations. Nevertheless, given the particular targets we are aware of, we are unsure of why these individuals would be of primary\n\ninterest to groups involved in illegal activities.\n\nAnother possibility, also unfalsi\ufb01able, is that a non-government group with political ambitions is responsible for Packrat. Such a\u0000\n\ngroup might be particularly interested in potential allies or sources of instability, as well as governments.\n\n6.3 Adjudicating between competing hypotheses\n\nUltimately, this report does not provide suf\ufb01cient data to conclusively adjudicate between hypotheses. However, we think that the\u0000\n\nbest \ufb01t, which is still circumstantial, is that the ultimate recipient of the information collected by Packrat is likely one or more\u0000\n\ngovernments in the region.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\nThis report described a seven year campaign with targets in several Latin American countries. While there are many well-known\n\nthreat actors in Latin America, many of the most visible are engaged in cybercrime. What distinguishes Packrat is the extensive and\n\noften ingenious targeting of political \ufb01gures, journalists and others. They are also distinguished by their ability to remain active over\u0000\n\nsuch an extended period, seemingly unfazed by discovery.\n\nPackrat highlights the extent to which multi-year campaigns can be run using limited technical sophistication, and a lot of creativity.\n\n\fFrom a technical perspective, they rely almost entirely on off-the-shelf RATs and packers to evade antivirus detection. Where they\n\nexcel is in the time and effort spent to create detailed and moderately convincing fake organizations to seed their malware.\n\nTheir persistence, and their willingness to keep using domains even after they are exposed suggests that exposure of their\n\ninfrastructure is not an existential threat. Their threats and taunts are similarly brazen. This strongly suggests, but does not prove,\n\nthat Packrat operates with a perception of safety.\n\nUltimately, this report does not conclusively attribute Packrat\u2019s activities, however we hope that by exposing their activities, we have\n\nprovided encouragement to others to continue to follow the thread.\n\nNote: The Precarious Position of Media in Latin America\n\nWhile we discourage a direct link between speci\ufb01c incidents of non-digital harassment of journalists and Packrat, the case highlights\u0000\n\nthe dif\ufb01cult situation faced by journalists and freedom of expression supporters in countries like Ecuador.\u0000\n\nIn Ecuador, for example, numerous observers, including the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, have\n\nexpressed concern that the freedoms afforded to journalists continue to be constricted. In Ecuador journalists, and even cartoonists,\n\nhave faced apparent retaliation for political speech. Journalist Martha Roldos, for example, had personal e-mails exposed in the\n\npress, and recordings of her conversations played in public. Freedom of expression and journalism organization Fundamedios,\n\nwhich has documented over 600 attacks against journalists from 2008-2012, has face forced shutdown. Interestingly, both of these\n\nindividuals were also targets of Packrat. While we have no evidence linking the perpetrators of these actions to Packrat, nor reason\n\nto believe the sponsor is the same, the targeted malware that we describe only adds to the threats these individuals and\n\norganizations face.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] See Appendix B for details.\n\n[2] bc97437fec7e7e8634c2eabae3cc4832\n\n[3] Sandboxes include ThreatExpert, Anubis, CWSandbox, JoeBox and Norman Sandbox.

Note that some of the sender emails look very similar to\n\nlegitimate e-mails of real people.\n\n \n \n\fAppendix B Malware Samples\n\nMD5\n\nC&C\n\ndd1101adc86fd282f5f183942cc2f3b7\n\nwjwj.no-ip.org ruley.no-ip.org\n\nlolinha.no-ip.org\n\n2d722592a4e3c8030410dccccb221ce4\n\nwjwj.no-ip.org\n\nFamily\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nd2adecc6287dd4d559fe6ce2ce7a7e31\n\n93b630891db21a4a2350280a360c713d\n\nwjwj.no-ip.org ruley.no-ip.org\n\nCybergate\n\nlolinha.no-ip.org\n\n(suspected)\n\nruley.no-ip.org wjwj.no-ip.org\n\nlolinha.no-ip.org\n\nCyberGate\n\na73351623577f44a2b578fed1e78e37e\n\nruley.no-ip.org wjwj.no-ip.org\n\nCyberGate\n\n5a8975873f52436377d8fb0b5ab0d87a\n\nruley.no-ip.org\n\nCyberGate\n\ned8d7ed45b64890b8901b735018318f3\n\nruley.no-ip.org wjwj.no-ip.org\n\nCyberGate\n\nc2237e9d415f542ce6e73adb260af123\n\n2827450763b55c5e71fda3caaf8e75f9\n\nbc97437fec7e7e8634c2eabae3cc4832\n\nd7f34168b1a7dd7cbd8e62a5ab1ebc0e\n\n6c34d4296126679d9c6a0bc2660dc453\n\nwjwj.no-ip.org\n\nwjwj.no-ip.org\n\nruley.no-ip.org\n\ntaskmgr.serveftp.com\n\ntaskmgr.serveftp.com\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\ntaskmgr.serveftp.com\n\nefc0009d76a2057f86c5f00030378c72\n\ndaynews.sytes.net\n\n74613eae84347183b4ca61b912a4573f\n\ndaynews.sytes.net\n\nd2f151312f7dee2483ddcab9766b56db\n\ndaynews.sytes.net\n\nea7bcf58a4ccdecb0c64e56b9998a4ac\n\ndaynews.sytes.net\n\n1e4265a0c37773c2372b97bb6630ae57\n\ndaynews.sytes.net\n\n08a3bb5b220eb1e0dc2ecccbbc6859f5\n\ndaynews.sytes.net\n\n2de51e74fd571319bbf763ec62781096\n\ndeyrep24.ddns.net\n\n8fb96dfab7e4c0acb1eb9f4e950ba4b9\n\ndeyrep24.ddns.net\n\n4a23a1d6779d199aaa582cf0a5868ad1\n\ndeyrep24.ddns.net\n\n0ae0038ffe8cf5c3170734a71ff2213d\n\ndeyrep24.ddns.net\n\n8e0f021dcbbfa586a1c6780e77ac0fb6\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\na74ef893b1bf21c9df6d8e31285db981\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\na988235ad7d47acbeca5ccb4ea5a1ed5\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\n15ebe16cd9500de534d5bfd5eeceaf73\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\n01dec1b1d0760d5a1a562edcfeb478d1\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\n1e6d0b59d4fb7650453c207688385f3a\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\ne03be1849ad7cecba1e20923074cd22f\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\n779a79c11f581b84e7c81f321fd8d743\n\nconhost.servehttp.com\n\n13d939b2412c6adbab3cc1b539166671\n\n7b2cb5249d704cb1df8d4210e7c3d553\n\nconhost.servehttp.com\n\ndllhost.servehttp.com\n\ndllhost.servehttp.com\n\nconhost.servehttp.com\n\na09f100ddc7cf29f8a93a3d7a79c58b9\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\nce6065346a918a813eeb58bbb0814a23\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\nea50bf8abcf9c0c40c4490dc15fb0a2a\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\n3a61d64986ee6529cee271ab6754faa5\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\n695db7dd3b1daf89f2c56d59faecc088\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n\nAppendix C: Malware Con\ufb01guration\u0000\n\nXtreme RAT\n\nXtreme RAT\n\nCyberGate\n\nXtreme RAT\n\nCyberGate\n\nAlienSpy\n\nAlienSpy\n\nAlienSpy\n\nAdzok\n\nAdzok\n\nAdzok\n\nAlienSpy\n\nAlienSpy\n\nAdzok\n\nAlienSpy\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\nCyberGate\n\n\fCyberGate RAT Con\ufb01guration\u0000\n\nAll Packrat\u2019s CyberGate samples seem to have been con\ufb01gured roughly in the same way, with only occasional changes in the\u0000\n\nCommand & Control domains and port.
