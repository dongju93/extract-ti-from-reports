Also,  note  that  the  Globally  Unique  Identifier  (GUID)4  is  unique  for  each  run  (for \n\nexample,  C83519C4-C8FE-4AB2-9061-A6B3D7525FC9).  Randomizing  the  GUID  is  a  way  to \n\nbypass malware detection based on file name. Using the same file name makes a piece of malware \n\neasy to detect.\n\n4   GUID is a unique reference number. It\u2019s a 128-bit value that is unique not only within an enterprise but also worldwide. Active Directory \n\ninternally uses GUID to identify objects.\n\n24 | The Spy Kittens Are Back: Rocket Kitten 2\n\n\f\u2022  The second line deletes the script in an attempt to hide the infection.\n\n\u2022  The  file,  NTUSER.dat{GUID}.exe  (SHA-1:  64ba130e627dd85c85d6534e769d239080e068dd, \n\ndetected by Trend Micro as \u201cBKDR_SWRORT.CP\u201d) has been dropped prior to launching the tmp.\n\nbat script.\n\n\u2022  BKDR_SWRORT.CP is a small downloader that communicates with and downloads files from the IP \n\naddress, 84.11.146.62. This IP address belongs to an IABG IP range (http://www.iabg.de/), a German \n\nsatellite communications provider that the attackers have been using for a long time.\n\n25 | The Spy Kittens Are Back: Rocket Kitten 2\n\n\fConclusion\n\n\fConclusion\n\nThe Rocket Kitten Group has been around for a while now. Based on research done by several security \n\ncompanies, including Trend Micro and ClearSky, we can assume that their activities will continue in the \n\nnear future, as they weren\u2019t deterred by making their existence and attack methods known.\n\nWe\u2019ve been observing the group for about a year now. The more information we gather about their tactics \n\nand methods, the more we are convinced that what we are facing is a group of resourceful and persistent \n\nactors. Rocket Kitten doesn\u2019t need sophisticated skills. The infection vectors that the group uses are very \n\nsimple. The malware they use are mostly purchased from third parties. But these shouldn\u2019t fool anyone \n\ninto thinking they\u2019re less difficult to deal with. Rocket Kitten makes up for their shortcomings by being \n\nextremely persistent and agile. The cases we analyzed in this paper show that careful planning and creativity \n\nare involved when they attempt to gain access to and gain a foothold in a target.\n\nTargeted  attacks  are  not  only  used  for  economic  advancement  via  stealing.  Rather,  they  should  be \n\nconsidered an evolution of the tradecraft of classic espionage, even in geopolitical relations.\n\n27 | The Spy Kittens Are Back: Rocket Kitten 2\n\n\fAppendix\n\nGeneral safety measures against targeted attacks\n\n\u2022\t Be vigilant; share information. First, be vigilant. The second has to do with information sharing. \n\nIf  you  think  or  know  that  you  are  being  targeted,  it  helps  to  be  familiar  with  and  conscious  of  the \n\nattackers\u2019 modus operandi. Therefore, examining emails, websites, and other forms of communication \n\ncan help you identify threats and avoid infection. Ask questions like \u201cDo you know the sender?\u201d; \u201cIs \n\nthis his address?\u201d; and \u201cDoes it make sense for him to use or send macros?\u201d When attack targets share \n\ninformation with colleagues, friends, and family members, the attackers have a harder time fooling \n\nthem. And if security analyses are available to investigate suspicious emails, files, and websites, it is \n\neven more crucial to share information. This helps you understand their tools and methods, technical \n\ninfrastructure, targets, and, perhaps, even their aims and objectives.\n\n\u2022\t Seek specialists\u2019 assistance in case of an attack. Even if you know that you are being attacked, \n\nyou  still  need  professional  guidance  from  specialists  who  can  analyze  incidents  and  provide  real-\n\ntime assistance. This is even more significant if attacks succeed. For example, attackers may execute \n\nnumerous  password-reset  attempts  at  the  same  time,  making  you  believe  you\u2019re  losing  control  of \n\nyour  accounts.  Without  professional  guidance,  you  can  make  a  mistake  like  give  your  credentials \n\nto  an  attacker,  click  a  malicious  link,  or  even  neglect  to  inform  your  service  provider  that  account \n\nrestoration should be canceled. The usual initial reaction to receiving suspicious messages is to delete \n\nthem. However, reporting suspicious messages to your organization\u2019s security team is crucial so they \n\ncan analyze attack methods, assess risks, and identify malicious content.\n\n\u2022\t Regularly  and  timely  update  software.  We  can  never  repeat  this  enough\u2014OSs  and  installed \n\nsoftware must be constantly updated with security fixes.\n\n\u2022\t Use up-to-date anti-malware solutions and Host Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPSs). \n\nThese software help detect threats.\n\n\u2022\t Regularly run network checks. If you run a network, regularly check log files or have them checked \n\nby  a security  professional. This will  help  you  discover malicious communication with  attackers and \n\nC&C servers.\n\nSpecific measures related to Rocket Kitten\n\n\u2022\t Pay close attention to senders\u2019 addresses even if they seem familiar. The fact that a message \n\nis part of a previous conversation does not mean that it is authentic (it could be an indication that the \n\nattacker took control of someone else\u2019s account). We have already seen email addresses with minor \n\nchanges used (one different letter in the address or domain and therefore seem identical at first sight).\n\n\u2022\t Do  not  enter  your  password  on  pages  you  were  led  to  by  links  embedded  in  emails. \n\nIt\u2019s  always  better  to  manually  type  desired  domain  addresses,  search  for  them  on  Google,  or  use \n\nbookmarked links.\n\n28 | The Spy Kittens Are Back: Rocket Kitten 2\n\n\f\u2022\t\n\nInform acquaintances about attacks. They can become targets as well.\n\n\u2022\t Known and \u201ctrusted\u201d websites can be hacked and used as part of an attack infrastructure. \n\nNever  automatically  trust  any  website.  Always  closely  check  websites  and  messages  and  look  for \n\nunreasonable mistakes (grammar, typos, etc.).\n\n\u2022\t\n\nImmediately report suspicious incidents. You may not have adequate professional knowledge \n\nand understanding of an attack. Therefore, it is vital to notify your organization\u2019s cybersecurity team \n\nof any suspicious incident. An example of this is receiving Facebook messages asking you to reset your \n\npassword or informing you of unauthorized access to your email account from an unknown user.\n\n\u2022\t Always\tflag\tmacro-laden\tfiles\tas\t\u201cvery\tsuspicious.\u201d\tReport them to your security team except if \n\nyou regularly work with macros. Asking you to \u201cEnable Content\u201d is very suspicious.\n\nWhile  IT  and  security  professionals  immediately  understand  what  the  message  means,  most  users \n\ndon\u2019t.  Nonetheless,  you  should  become  familiar  with  this  specific  message  (which  is  almost  always \n\nsuspicious),  as  opposed  to  the  \u201cProtected  View\u201d  message  that  doesn\u2019t  imply  if  opening  a  file  is  safe \n\n or unsafe.\n\n29 | The Spy Kittens Are Back: Rocket Kitten 2\n\n\fReferences\n\n1.
