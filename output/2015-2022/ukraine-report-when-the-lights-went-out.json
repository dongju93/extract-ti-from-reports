The \ninfected machine then sustains a critical error, \ndisplays a blue screen of death, and reboots with \nthe message \u201cOperating System not found.\u201d A \nthird observed sampleal executes nearly identically, \nthough the sample runs as its own process as \nopposed to dropping an embedded file onto the \ntargeted system to overwrite the data.\n\nA key point of variance between recovered \nsamples is the level of additional data destruction \n\nbeyond overwriting the master boot record. \nThough all samples ultimately rendered the \nmachines inoperable, in the samplesam,an \ndescribed above, a critical system error and forced \nreboot occurred without overwriting any additional \ndata on disk. This indicates that valuable data \nstored on the device may be recoverable, even if \nthe machine itself is inoperable.\n\nTwo other analyzed samplesao,ap included \nadditional data destruction beyond the MBR. The \nfirstaq runs as its own process and overwrites the \nfirst 131072 bytes of  \n\\Device\\Harddisk0\\DR0 with spaces, rendering \nthe OS unusable upon reboot. The sample then \ncontinues to overwrite thousands of files while the \nsystem remains powered on but unusable.

The BE \nplugins identified reflect the diverse use of this \nmalware, and the significant overlap in function-\nality across different plugins indicates that \nseveral distinct groups are actively using the tool. \nAt least 14 BE plugins have been identified in \npublic reporting, including:308,309 \n\n\u2022  FS.dll: Functions as a data exfiltration tool; \n\ngathers documents and private keys by search \nfor specific file extensions \n\n\u2022  SI.dll: Searches infected machines for specific \n\n\u2022 \n\nconfiguration and operational data\nJN.dll: Functions as a parasitic infector; fixes \nchecksum values in PE headers, fixes CRC32 \nNullsoft value, and deletes digital signatures \nto avoid invalidation\n\n\u2022  KI.dll: Records user key strokes on infected \n\nmachines\n\n\u2022  PS.dll: Searches infected machines for user \n\ncredentials\n\n\u2022  SS.dll: Captures screenshots on infected \n\nmachines\n\n\u2022  VS.dll: Functions as a network discovery and \nremote execution tool. Scans the infected \nnetwork to identify connected network \nresources, retrieves remote desktop \n\ncredentials, and attempts to establish \nconnections. Uses PsExec, which is embedded \nin the plugin, to gather system information \nand launch executables on remote machines\n\u2022  TV.dll: Searches for TeamViewer versions 6\u20138. \nIf the targeted application is identified, the \nplugin sets an additional password, creating \nan additional backdoor into the compromised \nsystem\n\n\u2022  RD.dll: Functions as a pseudo \u201cremote \n\ndesktop\u201d server\n\n\u2022  UP.dll: Used to update the hosted malware\n\u2022  DC.dll: Identifies Windows accounts on the \n\ninfected system\n\n\u2022  BS.dll: Conducts system profiling through \nqueries of system hardware, BIOS, and \nWindows information\n\n\u2022  DSTR.dll: Functions as a logic bomb. At a \n\nspecified time, the plugin rewrites files with \nspecific extensions with random data, deletes \nitself, and deletes the first 11 sectors of system \ndrive, then rewrites all remaining data \n\n\u2022  SCAN.dll: Functions as a network scanner on \n\ninfected systems. \n\nOf particular interest in the attacks against \nUkrainian electricity distributors are the SI and \nPS plugins. As plugins designed specifically to \nsearch for credential data, SI or PS are the likely \nplugins used following the initial infection. Data \ndestruction was also a component of the final \nstages of the attack, and though BE has a \ndedicated data destruction plugin, DSTR.dll, \npublic reporting indicates that the disk-wiping \ncomponent of the attack was achieved using the \nKillDisk malware. \n\nboozallen.com/ics         59\n\n \n\fThe SI plugin gathers a wide range of systems \ndata. Using the systeminfo.exe utility, SI gathers \nconfiguration information, including OS version, \nprivileges, current time, up time, idle time, and \nproxy.310 SI also identifies:311  \n\n\u2022 \n\nInstalled applications, using the uninstall \nprogram registry \n\n\u2022  Process list, using the tasklist.exe utility \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Network connections, using the  \n\nIP configurations, using the ipconfig.exe utility \n\nnetstat.exe utility\n\n\u2022  Routing tables, using the route.exe utility\n\u2022  Traceroute and Ping information to Google, \n\nusing tracert.exe and ping.exe\n\n\u2022  Mail, browser, and instant messaging clients. \n\nOf particular interest is its targeting of password \nmanagers and stored user credentials.312 SI is \ndesigned to pull credentials from The Bat! email \nclient, Mozilla password manager, Google \nChrome password manager, Outlook and \nOutlook Express, Internet Explorer, and Windows \nCredential Store, including credentials for \nWindows Live messenger services, Remote \nDesktop, and WinINET.313 If any of these \n\napplications or services were deployed on the \ntargeted systems, they would present a viable \navenue for gathering the valid user credentials \nthat the threat actors ultimately obtained in their \nattack. The PS.dll plugin is also specifically \ndesigned to search and exfiltrate credentials,314 \nand may have been used in the attack. Similarly, \nthe KI.dll may have been used to record and \ntransfer keystrokes during user authentication,  \nas some public reporting speculates.315 Detail  \non the specific function of these two plugins  \nwas not listed in public sources, and samples  \nof the .dll files were not located for analysis. \n\nOf the 15 plugins mentioned in this report, most \nwere initially developed for BE2, though they \ncould be recompiled for use with BE3.316 \nAccording to reporting in September 2015, SI was \nthe only plugin analyzed by security researchers \nthat had been updated for use with BE3 at that \ntime;317 this indicates SI may have been the tool \nused in the December 2015 attacks. Later \nreporting, in January 2015, indicated that all  \n14 of the plugins had been modified for  \ncompatibility with BE3.318 \n\n60 \n\nBooz Allen Hamilton\n\n\fA P P E N D I X   D : \nAlternate Remote Access Trojans\n\nThough the primary tool in the Ukraine attacks \nwas BlackEnergy (BE) 3, as noted above, several \nother remote access trojans (RAT) were observed \nin the phishing campaign leading up to the \nattacks.319 Several reports discussed  \nthe use of a modified version of Dropbear,320,321,322 \nan open-source SSH server and client executable \ndesigned as a lightweight server primarily for \nLinux-based embedded systems.323 As with BE3, \nthe modified Dropbear was launched using a \nVisual Basic (VB) scriptav delivered via a weapon-\nized Microsoft (MS) Excel document.324 At \nlaunch, the server is set to listen at port 6789.325 \nThe modified version of the Dropbear server \ncontained two backdoors, a hardcoded public key \nauthentication process, and a hardcoded \nusername and password, allowing threat actors \nto authenticate into the targeted system.326 One \nof the benefits, from an attacker\u2019s perspective, of \nusing a RAT such as the modified Dropbear \nserver, is that it is not inherently malicious, and \nunlike other RATs, it may not be recognized by \n\nautomated scanners designed to recognize \npotentially malicious files.327 Using an open-\nsource SSH client like Dropbear in the initial \ninfection would also limit the risk of exposing a \nmore complex and valuable piece of malware, \nsuch as BE3; if the malware is discovered, it \nwould not represent a significant loss from the \nattacker\u2019s perspective.\n\nDuring analysis of BE3 malware samples, \nanalysts did not find any technical link between \nBE3 and the other referenced RATs: GCat, \nDropbear, and Kryptik. It is possible, as some \npublic reporting indicates, that these additional \ntrojans were used by the same threat actors that \nconducted the attack on the electrical grid; in \nthe attack the threat actors used at least two \nseparate malware applications, BE3 and KillDisk. \nThere is no technical evidence to confirm these \nadditional trojans were used by the same group \nthough, and it is possible they had been \ndelivered to the targeted systems as part of \nseparate, unrelated attacks.\n\nav. \n\n  Appendix B.6: Dropbear Installer (DropbearRun.vbs) (MD5: 0af5b1e8eaf5ee4bd05227bf53050770)\n\nboozallen.com/ics         61\n\n \n\f\fA P P E N D I X   E :\nSources\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n\u201cIR-ALERT-H-16-043-01AP Cyber-Attack Against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure,\u201d US Department of Homeland Security \nIndustrial Control System Computer Emergency Response Team, March 7, 2016, accessed July 12, 2016, hxxps://info.publicin-\ntelligence.net/NCCIC-UkrainianPowerAttack.pdf.\n\n\u201c\u0418\u0417-\u0417\u0410 \u0425\u0410\u041a\u0415\u0420\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u0410\u0422\u0410\u041a\u0418 \u041e\u0411\u0415\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0427\u0418\u041b\u041e \u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e\u0412\u0418\u041d\u0423 \u0418\u0412\u0410\u041d\u041e-\u0424\u0420\u0410\u041d\u041a\u041e\u0412\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041e\u0411\u041b\u0410\u0421\u0422\u0418,\u201d TSN, December \n24, 2015, accessed April 13, 2016, http://ru.tsn.ua/ukrayina/iz-za-hakerskoy-ataki-obestochilo-polovinu-ivano-fran-\nkovskoy-oblasti-550406.html.\n\n\u201c\u0415\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u0456\u043a\u0432\u0456\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0442\u0430\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0442\u0456,\u201d \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0442\u044f\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043e, December 23, \n2015, accessed July 12, 2016, hxxp://www.oe.if.ua/showarticle.php?id=3413.\n\n\u201c\u041a\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430 BlackEnergy2/3. \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0430\u0442\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0418\u0422 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0443 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b,\u201d Cys Centrum, June 1, \n2016, accessed July 12, 2016, hxxps://cys-centrum.com/ru/news/black_energy_2_3.\n\nBlake Sobczak and Peter Behr, \u201cInside the diabolical Ukrainian hack that put the U.S. grid on high alert,\u201d Environment & \nEnergy Publishing, July 18, 2016, accessed July 21, 2016, hxxp://archive.is/lnnBf.\n\nRobert M.
