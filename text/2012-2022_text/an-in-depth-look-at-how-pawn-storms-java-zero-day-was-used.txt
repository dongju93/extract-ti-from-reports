Operation Pawn Storm is a campaign known to target military, embassy, and defense contractor
personnel from the United States and its allies. The attackers behind Operation Pawn Storm have been

active since at least 2007 and they continue to launch new campaigns.

Over the past year or so, we have seen numerous techniques and tactics employed by this campaign,
such as the use of an iOS espionage app, and the inclusion of new targets like the White House.

Recent Posts

Through our on-going investigation and monitoring of this targeted attack campaign, we found
suspicious URLs that hosted a newly discovered zero-day exploit in Java now identified by Oracle as
CVE-2015-2590. This is the first time in nearly two years that a new Java zero-day vulnerability  was

reported.

The report below outlines the traffic observed as part of the attack, not the exploit itself. Our blog entry
on how the exploit itself works can be found here. This blog entry is intended to help readers identify

traffic in their network that would indicate if such an exposure had occurred. We strongly recommend
that all readers roll out the Oracle patch as soon as possible

Infection sequence

Trend Micro has observed that an entity belonging to the target profile received an email that contains

the following URL:

hxxp://ausameetings[.]com/url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/

It is worth noting that the spearphishing domain used is ausameetings[.]com, a play on the valid

domain “ausameetings.org,” which is a site for AUSA’s (Association of the United States Army) annual
exposition, commonly held in mid-October. The domain was only registered last July 8, which implies a

one-time use for a specific set of targets.

When assessing this URL, it was determined that the most probable infection sequence is:

Like all multi-stage infections, a successful execution of the previous stage is required before moving to
the next stage down. In Stage 1, the sequence is initiated by clicking on the URL embedded within the
victim’s spearphishing email.

Once the Java exploit of Stage 1 is successful, it downloads the PE file (Stage 2). Once the PE file is
downloaded and executed it drops and runs the DLL file (Stage 3) which is the final component to infect
the machine with SEDNIT.

The information that we have on each of these steps is as follows.
Further information on each of these stages can be found in the sections below.

Stage 1 – the Java exploit

The first stage of the infection sequence comes through a targeted, spearphishing attempt against the

victim, which is the observed method for Operation Pawn Storm attacks.

The initial spearphishing URL is constructed similar to:

The web pages on this domain that were found to drop the Java zero-day exploit include:

The network traffic observed for the infection sequence of this stage is:

For completeness, the specific traffic calls observed relating to Stage 1 include the following:

Trend Micro detects these Java class files as JAVA_DLOADR.EFD:

App.class (7,552 bytes)

Go.class (1,373 bytes)

Help.class (5,667 bytes)

The second and third traffic calls in the traffic pattern are particularly interesting to note.

Figure 2. Traffic patterns (click the image to enlarge)

One can observe that the second call sends a POST to ausumeetings[.]com, and is returned with a text
responsecfa that then subsequently is used as the URI path for the subsequent HTTP requests.

Stage 2 – The PE file

Stage 2 involves downloading a PE file. Trend Micro detects this file as TROJ_DROPPR.CXC. The

primary purpose of this PE is to drop and load the DLL executable. It is downloaded as Cormac.mcr,

but once extracted, the file name is converted into a randomized file name. It is installed into
the %USERPROFILE% directory and then executed, creating a service by the same name.

During its installation, a variety of other services also appear to be hooked, including  lsass, lsm,

and conhost, amongst others.

Figure 3. Observed processes (click the image to enlarge)

Once the malware is executed, it will drop the Stage 3 DLL file with filename  api-ms-win-downlevel-

profile-l1-1-0.dll in the %TEMP% directory. To load the malware, it executes rundll32.exe using the

following command:

rundll32.exe “%temp%/api-ms-win-downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll”,init

Stage 3 – The DLL file

This third stage involves a DLL file, which we detect as TSPY_SEDNIT.C. When the PE file triggers the

DLL (in this instance, %windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe Command:

“%windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe ” “C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\ap i-ms-win-

downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll”,init), the following traffic was observed.

It bears stressing that we do not encourage using the data presented above as IOCs for your own

analysis. The network traffic generated by this stage was a challenge to assess as it appears to have
polymorphic capabilities in the creation of URI paths utilized to pull down files. After assessing the

samples multiple times, each network traffic infection sequence appeared to be different, no matter

what sequence of testing was performed (e.g., same machine, different machines, different geographic

IP space globally, etc.).

After detailed network forensics of the traffic, it was determined that no single stable URL path or URI
query component (URI path component, file name, or URI query parameter) showed a consistent

pattern (either same entry nor regex definable pattern), and further reverse engineering was required to

determine the methods used to achieve this.

As a result of this additional analysis, it was determined that the URI path is a random generated string

with the following pattern:

^/([a-zA-Z0-9]{1,6}/){1,5}[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,7}\.(xml|pdf|htm|zip)/\?[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,3}=<Encoded ID>

Figure 4. Regex expression

Included in the POST request is a data encoded with Base64 and XOR encryption. The encoded data
contains the following system information of the infected machine:

OS Version

List of running processes

Hard Disk Drive Information

Volume Serial Number

TSPY_SEDNIT.C connects to three C&C servers:

192[.]111[.]146[.]185 (direct to IP call)

www[.]acledit[.]com

www[.]biocpl[.]org

After sending the encrypted data it will wait for a reply which is encrypted by the same algorithm above.

Phase 2 of the attack: the keystroke logger

Based on our investigation of Operation Pawn Storm, we know that the infection happens in two

stages:

In phase 1, opening the email attachment or clicking on the malicious URI initiates the download of

the first level dropper, which installs the downloader component (.DLL file).

In phase 2, the downloader component communicates with a C&C server and downloads other

components, and at the end of the chain a keylogger is installer. The keylogger sends data back to

the C&C server.

As of writing, we have not succeeded in triggering Phase 2, which will download a fourth stage

malware from the C&C servers. This fourth stage malware is expected to be an encrypted executable
file.

Victims of the Attack

A number of victims were identified during the course of our investigation. The targets are in the United

States or Canada, and those we were able to identify via IP are big defense contractors, as typical for

Operation PawnStorm.

Countermeasures

Trend Micro is already able to protect users against this threat without any necessary updates. The

existing Sandbox with Script Analyzer engine, which is part of Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery, can be

used to detect this threat by its behavior. The Browser Exploit Prevention feature in the Endpoint

Security in Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suite detects the exploit once the user accesses the URL
that hosted it. Our Browser Exploit Prevention detects user systems against exploits targeting browsers

or related plugins.

Vulnerability protection in Trend Micro Deep Security protects user systems from threats that may

leverage this vulnerability with the following DPI rule:

1006857 – Oracle Java SE Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Oracle has also provided  a security patch for the related vulnerability.

Indicators of Compromise
