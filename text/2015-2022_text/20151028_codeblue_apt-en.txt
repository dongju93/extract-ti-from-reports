Methods Used to Spread Infection 

Patterns of spreading infection 

• Exploiting vulnerabilities (MS14-068 + 

MS14-058) 

• Investigating SYSVOL scripts 
• Password list-based attack 
• Exploiting Built-in Administrator 

password 

• Setting malware in file servers 
• Exploiting WPAD 
• Others 

22 

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Exploiting Vulnerabilities (MS14-068 + MS14-058)  

1. Escalate privilege (MS14-058) and 
dump user’s password with mimikatz 

2. Exploit MS14-068 vulnerability and 
gain Domain Admin privileges 

PC-A 

3. Upload mimikatz to DC and dump 
admin’s passwords 

Domain 
Controller 

4. Copy malware to PC-B 

6. Malware executes 
according to the task 

5. Register a task in order to execute malware 

PC-B 

23 

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

 
Investigating SYSVOL Scripts 

Key Point 

• In some cases, passwords are found in logon script, 

etc. 

Attacker’s 
Infrastructure 

Domain 
Controller 

1. Download logon script, 
compress and archive 

3. Search admin’s 
password 

6. Malware executes 
according to the task 

2. Download 

4. Copy malware to 
PC-B 

C2 Server 

PC-A 

5. Register a task in order 
to execute malware  

PC-B 

24 

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Password List-based Attack 

Key Point 

• Attempts logon by using an approximately 10-30 line password 

list and the user’s list of Domain Admins 
• Uses a tool called logon.exe (self-built?)  

1. Get user’s list of 
Domain Admins 

Domain 
Controller 

2. Attempts logon 
with logon.exe 

3. Copy malware  

5. Execute 

PC-A 

25 

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

4. Register a task  

PC-B 

Exploiting Built-in Administrator Password 

Key Point 

• An effective measure when there is no way to 

exploit Domain environment 

• Need to hash passwords or dump passwords 

1. Escalate privilege (UAC bypass) 
and dump user’s password 

5. Execute 

4. Register a task  

3. Copy malware  

PC-A 

2. Pass the hash or net use 

PC-B 

net use ¥¥PC-B¥IPC$ [password]  /u:Administrator 

26 

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Setting Malware in File Servers 

Key Point 

• Effective when there is no other measure  

1. Replace the existing file 
with malware disguised with 
fake icons 

File Server 

2. Execute 
malware in file 
servers 

PC-A 

PC-B 

27 

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

Exploiting WPAD 

WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery)  

— Turned on by default 
— Get automatic configuration script from either 

   URL specified by DHCP server, or 
   http://wpad/wpad.dat 

28 

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

 
 
 
 
Exploiting WPAD (Step 1: NetBIOS Spoofing) 

Key Point 

• Effective in an environment where WPAD is not 

configured 

• NetBIOS Spoofing 

1. Broadcast: Name query NB WPAD 

wpad.exe 

PC-A 

29 

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

2. Name query response 
   (I am WPAD) 

PC-B 

Exploiting WPAD (Step 2: Fake WPAD Server) 

wpad.dat (automatic configuration script) 
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) { 

if (myIpAddress() != “[PC-A addr]”) { 

return ‘PROXY wpad:8888;DIRECT’; 

} 
return ‘DIRECT’; 

} 

3. Request http://wpad/wpad.dat 

4. Response 

wpad.exe 

PC-A 

30 

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved. 

PC-B 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Exploiting WPAD (Step 3: Man in the Middle 
Proxy) 

Web site 

Attacker’s 
Infrastructure 

Attacker’s 
Web Site 

6. Drive-by download

wpad.exe 

5. Embed iframe in attacker’s 
Web site

Key Point 

AAA.example.com 

• Routing of only specific sub domains 
• Other DNS queries are routed to the 

legitimate DNS server
