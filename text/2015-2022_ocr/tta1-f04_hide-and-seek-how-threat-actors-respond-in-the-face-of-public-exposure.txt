#RSAC

Have you ever been directly involved in a public 
white paper or blog about a threat actor? 

Show of Hands

#RSAC

Do you use vendor white papers or blogs to develop better 
situational awareness about threats to your organization? 

Glossary of Terms

#RSAC

“APT” Groups: Groups conducting network 
operations on behalf of a nation state. Includes 
cyber espionage and network attack activity. 

“FIN” Groups: Well organized, capable 
intrusion teams that conduct intrusions for 
financial gain. Seek to steal information that 
can be monetized.  

TTPs: “Tactics, Techniques and Procedures” – the “toolkit” 
and methods threat actors use to achieve their objectives.

Why Does Exposure Matter? 

#RSAC

Public spotlight creates a flashpoint 
of awareness of a group’s ops, TTPS
Security vendors sprint to detect publicized 
activity

Net defenders more likely to hunt in their 
networks for evidence of a group, employ new 
IOCs or detection methods 

Exposure triggers public awareness and increases threat groups’ risk of 
detection/discovery.

Why Does Exposure Matter – Big Picture 

#RSAC

What ethical boundaries and obligations do 
security researchers face? 

Are we cultivating better OPSEC in the actors 
we expose? 

What is the best way to share? 

Mission vs. Marketing 

Key Concept

Threat Shifting 

#RSAC

“Response from adversaries to perceived safeguards 
and/or countermeasures, in which the adversaries 
change some characteristic of their [operations] in 
order to avoid and/or overcome those 
safeguards/countermeasures”

— NIST Special Publication 800-30: Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments

Threat Shifting in Nature 

#RSAC

Evolution to reduce the risk of predation

Mimickry: Heliconius butterflies mimic wing coloration patterns to signal toxicity to predators 

Threat Shifting in Information Security

#RSAC

Examples of Threat Shifting 

Evolution of banking Trojans from clumsy 
keyloggers to highly flexible webinject offerings

Adoption of Powershell and WMI for lateral 
movement and backdoor functionality 

Four Domains for Adaptation

#RSAC

Threat shifting occurs across four domains: 

TIMING

TARGETS

RESOURCES

PLANNING & 
METHODS

Trigger Points for Threat Shifting

#RSAC

Exposure 

Remediation

Detection 

A caveat…

#RSAC

Our observations are based 
on  FireEye’s visibility.

Research Question 

#RSAC

How do threat groups respond 
when their operations are 
exposed in public reporting? 

#RSAC

They know.

Threat groups are often keenly aware of 
research & reporting on their operations.  

They know.

#RSAC

APT28 signals they are aware of security 
researchers’ blogs (and none too pleased…)

July 2015 blog on APT28 spear phishing campaign 
that leveraged a Java zero-day

Within 1 day, APT28 updated DNS info for domain 
hosting exploit to point to TrendMicro’s IP space 

* APT28 aka Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, Fancy Bear, Strontium 

Keenly aware of research and reporting

#RSAC

Threat Actors Read the News, Too. 

APT1: Major interruption to APT1’s operations

Careto/Mask: “…after the post was published, the 
Mask operators shut everything down within 
about four hours” 

APT3 aka UPS: Changed tactics on the fly in direct 
response to FireEye blog 

Keen awareness: APT29

Operation SMN — APT17 Interdiction 

#RSAC

APT17 aka Axiom, DeputyDog, Tailgater Team, Hidden Lynx, Voho, Group72, AuroraPanda

More than an exposure effort:

- Coalition sought to eradicate specific ‘high value’ tools and  

make it more expensive for APT17 to operate 

- Coordinated action was accompanied by public materials to 

aid detection and educate victims 

Operation SMN coalition went into the 
effort with eyes wide open:

- Acknowledged from outset that APT17 was skilled, equipped 

to adapt and would very likely retool

In Summary… 

Hide and Seek: How Threat Actors Respond in the 
Face of Public Exposure 

#RSAC

Key Takeaways 
Threat actors are often keenly aware of reporting on 
their operations

Exposure can disrupt an actor’s operations… if the 
incentives are right. 

Public reporting triggers retooling 

Actors may abandon tools or develop new ones.

The path of least resistance is often king.

Sometimes, actors solve the problem by adding 
resources: time, money, tool development

Hide and Seek: How Threat Actors Respond in the 
Face of Public Exposure 

#RSAC

Exposure is a 
balancing act 

Security researchers must continually weigh 
the benefits of public awareness against 
possible disruptions to detection and loss of 
visibility. 

When executed well, exposure benefits 
victims, network defenders and the security 
community at large.  

Questions to Ask 

#RSAC

When evaluating whether exposing an adversary 
is the best course of action: 

- What impact do we want to have on the adversary? 

When evaluating how a threat actor will likely 
respond when their operations are exposed: 
- How adaptive and capable is the group? 

- How will exposure help/hurt victims and likely future 

targets? 

- Groups with a flat toolset and low adaptive 
capability are more likely to be disrupted 

- How will exposure impact ‘big picture’ concerns like 

- How determined are they to maintain access to 

law enforcement efforts?  

specific targets? 

- Will exposure degrade our ability to detect and 

respond to future activity?

- What shifts to targeting, timing, resourcing & TTPs 

is the actor likely to make?

#RSAC
