Executive Summary

To maximize its influence over international audiences, the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is striving to tailor its propaganda 
to  the  specific  interests  of  target  populations.  This  approach, 
which  is  defined  by  the  concept  of  “precise  communication”, 
adapts the market segmentation tactics of advertisers to design 
content and dissemination methods that appeal to the preferences 
of a given group. China’s implementation of this strategy requires 
an in-depth understanding of target audiences, which is being 
attained  —  with  the  aid  of  international  firms  —  through  area 
studies research, in-country surveys, and online behavioral data. 
Precise communication has been heralded as a necessity and an 
era-defining shift by party-state media researchers; it is almost 
certainly driving an era of greater adaptability within the CCP’s 
propaganda apparatus, including party-state media’s deepening 
overseas localization, and very likely informing the CCP’s use of 
internet  personalities  for  propaganda.  Obstacles  such  as  data 
privacy  laws  and  international  social  media  platform  counter-
measures are likely to inhibit the full realization of the CCP’s goal, 
but the party’s propaganda apparatus is actively seeking to find 1 
“key” — a targeted message — for 1 “lock” — a specific audience 
that, from the party’s perspective, needs to be influenced.1

Key Judgments

•  The current era of the CCP’s external propaganda work is 
marked by the increasing granularity with which content 
can be tailored based on audience data and modern 
communication technologies.

•  Chinese communication researchers propose segmenting 
audiences based on individual, community, or country-
level characteristics such as culture, economic 
development, religious faith, customs, and personal 
interests.

•  Achieving an in-depth understanding of target audiences 
is a prerequisite for success, and data from in-country 
surveys and online behavioral data collected with 
the assistance of domestic public opinion-monitoring 
companies and international research and social media 
firms is almost certainly being used to fulfill this demand.

•  The CCP external propaganda apparatus is likely 

to continue expanding global data collection, seek 
to leverage advertising data, and evolve its tactics 
according to the latest advertising strategies that strive 
to circumvent hurdles such as those posed by data 
privacy laws — jurisdictions with lax regulations likely 
face greater risk.

•  Party-state media is almost certainly among the leading 
implementers of precise communication, but a wide 
range of actors are also very likely to be directly or 
indirectly involved; some Chinese academics argue that 
precise communication should entail selecting the right 
communicator for maximum effect given the target and 
content.

•  The precise communication concept is almost certainly 

intended to influence all of the CCP’s propaganda output, 
from news distribution through third parties, to TV show 
production, to the online and social media activities of 
party-state media and Chinese diplomats.

•  The content disseminated by party-state media and 

other elements of the external propaganda apparatus is 
likely to become increasingly diverse, first according to 
country differences and then based on social strata and 
other community-level characteristics.

•  New forms of media that adopt different approaches 

are likely to continue proliferating, with recent examples 
including online lifestyle influencers and newsletters.

20 Years of CCP External Propaganda Work

The Chinese Communist Party is striving to seize the “right to 
speak” (话语权) and to “set the agenda” (议题设置) internationally. 
Stated simply, this means creating an environment in which the 
party  shapes  what  is  talked  about  and  how  a  given  issue  is 
perceived, with the goal of subsequently shaping the behavior 
of  global  audiences  in  ways  that  are  beneficial  to  the  CCP’s 
interests.2  Core  efforts  in  the  creation  of  such  an  environment 
are  “news  and  public  opinion  work”  (新闻舆论工作)  and  “public 
opinion guidance” (舆论引导). These concepts refer to long-term, 
continuous efforts to influence how people view social issues and 
government policies to “dispel misgivings and clear up confusion, 
[and] shape feelings” so that audiences have “correct” views as 
defined by the CCP.3

To  guide  international  public  opinion  on  topics  related  to 
China and the party’s policies, the CCP’s strategic concepts for 
effectively  conducting  “external  propaganda”  (对外宣传)  have 
steadily matured and its information dissemination architecture 
has expanded over the last 20 years. This movement began to 
surge in 2004. The party-state created new leading bodies for 
external  propaganda  work;  resolved  to  craft  a  “great  external 
propaganda pattern” (大外宣格局) that involved a variety of actors 
— central and local government entities, companies, academic 
institutions, and non-governmental organizations — “singing the 
same  tune”;  and  expanded  existing  information  dissemination 
channels  such  as  the  government  and  CCP  spokesperson 
system.4

A core part of the external propaganda upgrade that began 
in  the  early  2000s  was  the  drive  to  expand  party-state  news 
media  globally.  By  early  2009,  China’s  Ministry  of  Finance  had 
reportedly budgeted 45 billion RMB (6.5 billion USD in  January 
2009)  for  the  internationalization  of  China  Central  Television 
(CCTV;  中国中央电视台),  Xinhua  News  Agency  (新华新闻社), 
People’s  Daily  (人民日报),  and  other  outlets.  In  June  2009, 
central  authorities  issued  the  “2009-2020  Overall  Plan  for 
Building  My  Country’s  Key  Media  International  Communication 
Capabilities”  (2009—2020年我国重点媒体国际传播力建设总体规
划), which outlined how central party-state outlets would build 
a modern system for international communication, use emerging 
media to create “breakthrough openings”, and improve editing, 
distribution,  and  product  marketing  to  “form  an  international 
communication capability matching [China’s] level of economic 
development and international status”.

Chinese  media’s  internationalization,  or  “Going  Out”  (走
出去),  involves  newspapers,  TV  stations,  radio  stations,  and 
online media outlets establishing foreign offices, publishing and 
broadcasting in all major languages, paying for content inserts 
in  foreign  publications,  distributing  free  news  content,  running 
ad  campaigns  online  and  offline,  and  establishing  a  social 
media  presence  on  most  foreign  platforms.  Since  2015,  focus 
has increasingly been placed on “localization” (本土化), including 
by  acquiring  local  media  companies,  hiring  foreign  staff,  and 
partnering with local media for co-production.5 

2019  marked  a  turning  point  in  China’s  use  of  online 
disinformation,  with  foreign-facing  computational  propaganda 6 
increasing rapidly. The challenges posed to China’s international 
image by the party’s suppression of pro-democracy protests in 
Hong Kong (2019-2020) and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic 
(2020-present) are almost certainly what drove greater numbers 
of Chinese diplomats onto global social media platforms. Further, 
under official instructions from the CCP’s leadership to “dare to 
flash  the  sword  (敢于亮剑)  .  .  .  [and]  counterattack  all  kinds  of 
anti-China arguments”,7 the messaging from China’s propaganda 
apparatus  has  become  more  coercive  in  this  period.  However, 
observers noted an emerging “forceful” and “provocative” tenor 
in China’s diplomatic communications in earlier years and Taiwan 
has  been  the  target  of  suspected  Chinese  online  information 
influence operations since at least mid-2017. 8 

In  the  post-2019  period,  inauthentic  campaigns  and  online 
personalities have become staples of CCP propaganda. YouTube, 
Facebook, and other global social media platforms have removed 
tens  of  thousands  of  accounts  suspected  of  inauthentic 
manipulation attributed to China in the past 3 years. Such accounts 
amplify China’s diplomatic discourse and spread “political spam” 
related to CCP narratives. Chinese party-state media personnel, 
meanwhile, are becoming international influencers who use their 
“personal brands” to disseminate cultural, lifestyle, and political 
content.  The  voices  of  Chinese  influencers  are  augmented  by 
foreign  personalities  who  collaborate  with  and  are  amplified 
by  party-state  media.  The  goal  is  to  bring  together  multiple 
communicators  “like  voices  in  a  choir”  to  reflect  “a  fuller  .  .  . 
vision of China” in a tactic called “polyphonous communication” 
(复调传播).

Lastly,  there  has  been  a  deepening  government-directed 
focus  in  recent  years  on  what  new  technologies,  especially 
bulk  data  collection  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI),  mean  for 
propaganda work in China and abroad. Broadly, AI is seen as a tool 
for overcoming the challenges posed by the plurality of voices 
and speed of communication on the internet, which is considered 
the  “most  forward  front  of  public  opinion  struggle”.  Combined 
with the right data, Chinese communication researchers believe 
AI can assist the media and propaganda apparatus in achieving 
early  warning  of  undesirable  narratives  before  they  go  viral 
online,  create  content  that  more  effectively  resonates  with 
audiences, and distribute content according to user interests.

Precise Communication as Propaganda Strategy

“Precise  communication”  or  “precision  communication”  
(精准传播)  is  the  CCP’s  strategic  concept  for  maximizing  the 
international influence of its news media and other propaganda 
work.9  The  term  is  derived  from  advertising  tactics  that  use 
consumer  data  to  segment  a  target  audience  so  that  tailored 
marketing can successfully influence the behavior of a specific 
group.10  It  is  considered  a  “foundational  principle”  (基本原则)11 
of  external  propaganda.12  A  closely  related  concept  is  “One 
Country, One Policy” (一国一策), which emphasizes that there are 
differences between countries that should inform the design of 
China’s media content.13 Under precise communication and One 
Country, One Policy, the CCP’s propaganda apparatus is actively 
attempting to achieve a more in-depth understanding of target 
audiences and is striving to customize its output accordingly.14

As  part  of  this  strategy,  according  to  the  CCP  Central 
Propaganda  Depar tment  (中共中央宣传部)-authored  text 
Propaganda  and  Thought  Work  in  the  New  Era,15  CCP  cadres 
are instructed to 

formulate country communication plans . . . persist 
in “content is king” . . . make news products more 
attractive . . . strengthen country communication 
research; go deep into the cultural context of foreign 
audiences; understand their value concepts, ways of 
thinking, and discourse style; [and] adopt targeted [针
对性], differentiated [差异性], and individualized [个性
化] communication tactics.

CCP  General  Secretary  Xi  Jinping  (习近平)  urged  this 

approach at a mid-2021 Politburo study session: 

use precise communication methods that stick 
closely to the audiences of different regions, 
different countries, [and] different groups, promote 
the globalized expression, regionalized expression, 
[and] audience differentiationalized expression of 
China’s story and . . . voice, [and] strengthen the 
effectiveness and affinity of [China’s] international 
communication. 

Whereas  the  CCP’s  propaganda  apparatus  was  previously 
focused on solving “the issue of how China’s voice can ‘go out’”, 
the task now is to “solve how [China’s voice] can ‘go in’ [走进去]” 
to the minds and hearts of people overseas. Thus, the adoption 
of precise communication and One Country, One Policy mark an 
“era-defining  leap”  (划时代飞跃)  away  from  the  “standardized”, 
one-size-fits-all approach to communications of old, according 
to  the  director  of  the  International  Communication  Research 
Office of Xinhua’s Journalism Research Institute (新华社新闻研究
所国际传播研究室).  As  demonstrated  in  the  “Theories  of  Target 
Selection” section of this report, precise communication entails 
targeting  groups  of  people  below  the  country-level.  Scholars 
from  Hunan  University  (湖南大学)  asserted  in  a  2018  People’s 
Daily  article  that  it  is  now  necessary  to  “implement  precise 
communication, [and] achieve [a situation in which] ‘1 key opens 
1 lock’” — the locks being specific audiences and the keys being 
China’s tailored content. 

2015: A New Era Begins

The  precise  communication-focused  era  of  CCP  external 
propaganda work very likely began in approximately 2015, based 
on trends in academic publishing and early examples of audience 
differentiation tactics. The strategy was almost certainly formally 
adopted — and broadly recognized as policy in China — by no 
later  than  2017.  It  is  almost  certainly  still  influencing  policies 
related  to  technology  and  media  and  “information  content 
supply-side reform”,16 which likely includes, for example, efforts 
to  elevate  young  journalism  professionals  in  order  to  better 
communicate with international youth audiences. While China’s 
propaganda  apparatus  has  sought  to  make  its  content  more 
accessible  and  appealing  since  at  least  2009,  the  current  era 
of  propaganda  work  is  marked  by  the  increasing  granularity 
with which content can be tailored based on audience data and 
modern communication technologies.

Figure 1: Emergence of topics in external propaganda strategy research (see Appendix B for methodology); the Control line is all articles that reference “precise communication” 
in the title, abstract, or keywords, regardless of the topic (Source: Chinese academic database; compiled by Recorded Future)

Analysis  of  Chinese  academic  articles  shows  that  precise 
communication  has  been  a  research  focus  in  China  since  the 
mid-2000s,17  but  the  vast  majority  of  early  (and  many  recent) 
articles relate to commercial advertising. Dr. Anne-Marie Brady, 
a  professor  at  the  University  of  Canterbury,  has  argued  that 
China’s  propaganda  apparatus  began  borrowing  theories  from 
the advertising industry in the 1990s.18 Precise communication 
is  almost  certainly  a  theory  absorbed  from  this  field,  with 
some  writings  acknowledging  this  advertising  link.19  In  both 
external  propaganda  and  advertising,  the  implementation  of 
precision-based strategies is intimately linked to the evolution 
of  communication  technologies.  Chinese  communication 
researchers believe that the current trends in communications, 
AI,  and  data  processing  technologies  offer  “advantageous 
conditions”  for  using  the  behavioral  data  generated  online  to 
reach  target  audiences  (see  the  “Preparing  the  Keys”  section 
for more on this topic).

Precise  communication  for  external  propaganda  work  was 
being  discussed  as  early  as  2010,  but  it  was  not  until  2015 
that  the  number  of  articles  annually  published  on  this  topic 
reached  double  digits  (see  Figure  1).  Assuming  an  average 
1-year  lag  between  writing  and  publishing,  this  data  points  to 
2014  as  the  year  when  research  into  precise  communication 
for foreign propaganda started becoming mainstream. Figure 1 
also  indicates  that  the  One  Country,  One  Policy  concept  likely 
began  emerging  in  2016  (a  year  prior  to  the  2017  increase  in 

publications). Research into the use of influential personalities 
—  including  internet  influencers  —  emerged  in  the  2007-2008 
period  and  has  boomed  since  2017.  See  the  “Influencers  and 
Newsletters” section for more discussion of this tactic in relation 
to precise communication.

These  findings  roughly  correspond  to  some  of  the  first 
authoritative  indications  of  precise  communication  being 
implemented  as  part  of  the  CCP’s  overseas  propaganda 
work,  which  occurred  in  the  2015-2016  period.  For  instance, 
People’s Daily Overseas Edition (人民日报海外版)  highlighted its 
implementation of “audience differentiation” (分众化) in May 2015 
and began experimenting with new forms of communication via 
WeChat the year prior. Dr. Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow with 
the German Marshall Fund, argues that “since 2015 CCP media 
have been pursuing a strategy of media localization . . . offering 
content in more languages and targeted at specific countries”. 
Although it appears not to have been explicitly linked to precise 
communication,  China  Global  Television  Network  (CGTN;  中国
国际电视台;  中国环球电视网)  was  also  established  at  the  end  of 
2016, rebranding CCTV’s overseas presence in a bid to aid the 
CCP’s “international public opinion discourse power”.

At  a  February  2016  CCP  journalism  and  public  opinion 
work  symposium  (新闻舆论工作座谈会),  Xi  Jinping  personally 
elaborated,  likely  for  the  first  time  publicly,  the  core  tenets  of 
precise communication: 

[We] must innovate [our] forms of external 
discourse and expression, research the habits and 
characteristics of different foreign audiences; adopt 
concepts, categories, and formulations that integrate 
the Chinese with the foreign; unite what we want to 
say with what foreign audiences want to hear; unite 
“emotion” (陈情) and “logic” ( 说理); [and] unite “I 
speak” with “others speak”; to make the international 
community and foreign audiences recognize (认同) 
[China’s] stories more. 

Following  Xi  Jinping’s  early  2016  instruction,  the  State 
Council Information Office (SCIO; 国务院新闻办公室) published a 
report discussing how China Daily (中国日报) was implementing 
the  new  strategy.  It  highlights  how  China  Daily  implements 
“reader audience differentiation” (读者分众化) and uses “audience 
differentiated  [social  media]  accounts  that  target  different 
regions  [and]  the  demands  of  different  readers  with  the  goal 
of realizing precise communication”. That China Daily was able 
to  point  to  its  activities  in  prior  years  as  evidence  of  this  — 
such as the creation of its United States (US) Edition in 2009 — 
highlights how the CCP was striving to make its communications 
more receptive to foreign audiences even prior to 2015-2016. But 
as noted above, Chinese party-state media researchers believe 
the  previous  period  was  more  focused  on  expanding  China’s 
voice than the high-fidelity targeting that is now being pursued.

By  no  later  than  2017,  precise  communication  and  One 
Country,  One  Policy  were  new  pillars  of  the  CCP’s  external 
propaganda  strategy  and  almost  certainly  widely  understood 
as  such.  Hu  Bangsheng  (胡邦胜),  the  deputy  head  of  China 
Radio  International  (CRI;  中国国际广播电台)  in  2017,  included 
One Country, One Policy in an article titled “How My Country’s 
External  Propaganda  Realizes  Precise  Communication”.20  This 
was  published  in  the  CCP  Central  Party  School’s  (中共中央党
校)  journal,  Chinese  Cadres  Tribune  (中国党政干部论坛),  with  a 
version  amplified  by  People’s  Daily  Online  (人民网).  At  the  5th 
National  External  Communication  Theory  Seminar  (第五届全国
对外传播理论研讨会)  hosted  by  the  Communication  University 
of China (CUC; 中国传媒大学) that year, then-deputy director of 
the SCIO Guo Weimin (郭卫民) argued that the “new chapter” of 
China’s  external  propaganda  required  audience  differentiation, 
improved precision, and “‘One Country, One Policy’, ‘One Country, 

Many Policies’” (一国多策). Then-CUC dean Hu Zhengrong (胡正
荣) presented a paper at the same seminar on One Country, One 
Policy  and  precise  communication  as  “essentials”  of  effective 
international  communication.21  Highlighting  awareness  of  the 
new strategy, scholars at Tsinghua University identified precise 
communication as 1 of 4 main themes in a review of more than 
1,200  academic  articles  from  2017  related  to  international 
communication. 

Emphasizing, in addition to Xi Jinping’s 2021 remarks quoted 
above, that the precise communication almost certainly remains 
relevant to CCP authorities post-2017, the National Social Science 
Fund  of  China  (NSSFC;  国家社会科学基金)  funded  research  in 
September  2020  on  “Precise  Communication  Strategy  for  the 
‘Belt  and  Road’  Initiative  on  Overseas  Social  Media  Platforms” 
(“一带一路”倡议在海外社交平台的精准传播策略).22  The  NSSFC  is 
administered by the National Planning Office of Philosophy and 
Social  Sciences  (NPOPSS;  全国哲学社会科学工作办公室),  which 
is  located  within  the  CCP  Central  Propaganda  Department.23 
Propaganda  and  Thought  Work  in  the  New  Era,  which  names 
precise  communication  as  a  “foundational  principle”,  was 
originally  published  in  December  2020  and  republished  in 
March 2021.24 In June 2022, China Daily’s editor-in-chief further 
noted  that  “continually  increasing  the  precision…  of  [China’s] 
international  communication”  is  among  the  outlet’s  forward-
looking goals.

Theories of Target Selection

While  the  CCP’s  policies  regarding  target  selection  are  not 
known,  communications  researchers  and  media  practitioners 
in  China  have  provided  a  number  of  theories  elaborating  how 
external  propaganda  based  on  country-level  distinctions 
and  sub-country  groups  could  work  in  practice.  They  tend  to 
focus  on:  distinctions  between  ethnicity,  culture,  religion,  and 
similar  factors;  overall  bilateral  relations  between  China  and 
the  target;  and  individual  characteristics  such  as  profession, 
gender,  and  hobbies.  These  are  not  authoritative  descriptions 
of internal policy, but such research is likely similar to the kinds 
of discussions being had, and decisions being made, inside the 
CCP’s propaganda apparatus.

Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com

Among  the  earliest  academic  ar ticulations  of  how 
propaganda  targets  could  be  grouped  is  a  2015  article  by  the 
same  Hunan  University  scholars  previously  cited.  They  argue 
that international communication audiences should be grouped 
into 2 broad categories with sub-groups that determine the goal 
and content of China’s international communications, which are 
described below. Their ideas attracted the party’s attention: this 
article was first published in People’s Daily and republished by 
the  SCIO  and  by  the  website  of  the  CCP’s  premier  theoretical 
journal, Qiushi Online (求是网; QS Theory). 25

•	 “Fundamental”	(基本盘)	Category:	Strengthening 

communication with audiences in this category is critical 
to increasing China’s overall international communication 
power. The authors do not explicitly say why, but it 
is most likely because they believe audiences in this 
category will help establish a base of people who trust 
and share China’s communications. Audiences include: 1) 
Chinese people living overseas; 2) people in peripheral 
countries (regions); 3) people in “third-world countries”; 
4) people in countries (regions) that are traditionally 
friendly to China; and 5) people in other countries 
with “relatively close economic, political, and cultural 
connections” with China.

•	 “Key”	(重点盘)	Category:	Communication with audiences 
in this category is important for strengthening China’s 
“right to speak”. The main audiences in this category 
are people in Western developed countries, namely in 
Europe and the US, as well as Western think tanks. This 
is because Western media enjoys a “monopoly of global 
communication resources” that countries in this category 
use to set global public opinion and because Western 
think tanks influence global governments.

The  authors  from  Hunan  University  further  argue  that 
communication  content  should  be  sorted  into  “fundamental” 
and  “key”  categories  also.  The  fundamental  content  category 
involves  using  finance,  science  and  technology,  education, 
culture,  health,  sports,  and  other  topics  to  “disseminate 
information, delegate knowledge, [and] provide entertainment” 
(传播信息、传授知识、提供娱乐)  because  these  issues  have 
relatively little ideological color and will be more readily accepted 
by  international  audiences.  The  key  content  category  involves 
“disseminating  China’s  voice,  China’s  proposals,  [and]  China’s 
positions [to] influence and guide public opinion and strengthen 
China’s right to speak”. 

The  most  explicit,  semi-authoritative  statement  on  how 
targeting should occur under One Country, One Policy is found 

in the aforementioned 2017 article by then-deputy CRI head Hu 
Bangsheng. Hu discusses the need to understand the following 
characteristics  of  “every  country”:  historical  culture,  economic 
development  level,  social  development  phase,  religious  faith, 
customs  and  habits,  and  the  personal  interests  of  audiences. 
Within  countries,  Hu  emphasizes  the  “situations”  of  different 
regions,  different  ethnicities,  and  different  languages.26  Also 
writing  in  2017,  a  scholar  from  East  China  Normal  University’s 
School of Marxism (华东师范大学马克思主义学院) has  advocated 
that the precise communication of China’s core socialist values 
can  target  propaganda  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  value 
orientation  and  interests  of  political  groups  (such  as  level  of 
government,  public  work  units,  and  civil-social  organizations) 
and occupational fields (such as agriculture, industry, commercial 
sector,  and  services).  While  this  scholar  is  largely  concerned 
with domestic propaganda work, they explicitly see China’s core 
socialist  values  as  a  cultural  export  and  assert  that  the  target 
audience should include Chinese people in Hong Kong, Macau, 
Taiwan, and other jurisdictions.

While  China’s  communications  infrastructure  is  now  global 
in  scope,27  some  Chinese  researchers  argue  that  external 
communications should more narrowly focus on countries, and 
their audiences, where influence will best serve China’s political, 
economic, and cultural interests.28 From this perspective, other 
researchers  from  Hunan  University  suggest  classifying  target 
countries  according  to  an  “inverted  pin”  (倒品字)  model. 29  In 
this  model,  target  countries  would  be  selected  based  on  the 
relationship  between  their  distance  from  China  in  terms  of 
geography, culture, psychology, and language; the international 
influence they possess; and China’s interests.30

Other  researchers  have  proposed  a  more  comprehensive 
and forward-looking model for how China should achieve precise 
communication  based  on  stratification  (分层),  classification  (
分类),  and  grouping  (分群),  as  defined  below.  This  model  was 
put  forward  in  2021  by  Hu  Zhengrong,  former  CUC  dean  and 
the  current  head  of  the  Chinese  Academy  of  Social  Sciences’ 
Journalism  and  Communication  Research  Institute  (中国社会科
学院新闻与传播研究所), and a media practitioner 31 affiliated with 
China Media Group’s (CMG; 中央广播电视总台) Hong Kong-Macau-
Taiwan Programs Center (港澳台节目中心). Hu and his co-author 
argue that stratified communication, classified communication, 
and group communication are a principle (原则), a strategy (策略), 
and a method (方法), respectively. Although the authors do not 
explicitly call this a “model”, when viewed together, the 3 features 
can be understood as an outline for a potential future “Chinese 
discourse  and  Chinese  narrative  system  of  systems”  (中国话语
和中国叙事体系)  that  involves  participation  from  government, 
media, companies, and think tanks.

Appendix  A  presents  a  diagram  of  the  model  proposed  by 
Hu and his co-author with their examples of specific targets and 
suggestions  for  how  to  differentiate  content  based  on  target 
audience  characteristics.  The  core  components  of  the  model 
are summarized below:

•  CCP Central Propaganda Department

•  State Council Information Office33

•  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA; 外交部)

•  Propaganda departments (宣传部门) 34

•	 Stratification: This means differentiating among various 
social classes, such as political elites and the masses, 
and communicating with these classes in different 
manners, with different content.

•	 Classification:	This means A) differentiating the roles 
that various entities within China play in international 
communication and B) differentiating discourse targets, 
first regionally, then gradually by country.

•	 Grouping: This means targeting content and choosing 
communication channels to be maximally effective for 
granular segments of a given social class, country, or 
region based on factors like the target audience’s gender, 
religion, interests, and hobbies. 

Interestingly, Hu and his co-author assert that One Country, 
One  Policy  has  fallen  short  of  its  goals  due  to  limited  human 
capital,  funding,  and  dissemination  channels  (渠道手段).  They 
state  that  implementing  One  Country,  One  Policy  in  the  short 
term  is  still  “very  challenging”  from  the  perspective  of  2021, 
and  that  “completely  realizing  [the  goal  of]  closely  sticking 
to  different  countries  and  adopting  different  communication 
methods  is  not  realistic”  at  this  time.  Achieving  this  is  still  the 
ultimate goal, but it first requires improvements to China’s overall 
discourse system. This is why they argue that China should first 
differentiate  (classify)  based  on  regions  or  blocs  of  countries 
and gradually work toward achieving One Country, One Policy.

Actors: The Right Voice for the Message

While official party-state media outlets are almost certainly 
among the leading implementers of precise communication efforts 
given their public opinion guidance mission, others are also very 
likely  involved.  As  discussed  below,  precise  communication  is 
most likely converging with other external propaganda strategies 
that  focus  on  finding  the  right  communicator  for  achieving 
influence among a target audience. 

Authoritative  sources  such  as  Propaganda  and  Thought 
Work  in  the  New  Era  do  not  explicitly  identify  what  entities 
are  responsible  for  carrying  out  this  strategy.  Given  precise 
communication’s status as a “foundational principle” for external 
propaganda, it is likely meant to be implemented or facilitated by 
a wide range of entities that contribute to China’s international 
communications.  The  entities  and  types  of  entities  named  in 
academic writing on precise communication, news reports about 
One  Country,  One  Policy  in  practice,  and  the  discussion32  in 
Propaganda  and  Thought  Work  in  the  New  Era  regarding  how 
the CCP’s external propaganda is implemented broadly include, 
but are not limited to:

•  Local government departments35

•  “Mainstream media” (主流媒体) 36

•  State-owned and private enterprises

•  Chinese think tanks37

While the focus of precise communication is on finding out 
what to say to the right audience and how to say it for maximum 
effect,  some  researchers  also  assert  that  China  must  select 
the  right  communicator  for  disseminating  information  to  the 
target.  The  model  put  forward  by  Hu  Zhengrong  and  his  co-
author includes such an argument, for example (see Appendix A). 
Although not always linked to precise communication explicitly, 
this idea is often seen alongside it in writings that discuss the 
trajectory of the CCP’s strategy. As noted in the “CCP External 
Propaganda Work” background section, since at least 2004, the 
CCP has sought to coordinate the dissemination of its narratives 
and  preferred  image  of  China  internationally  through  a  variety 
of entities that form a “chorus” of voices and “tell China’s story 
well on every battlefront”.38 

The following sections, “Preparing the Keys” and “Opening the 
Locks”, also discuss how social media and marketing companies 
in  China  and  abroad  aid  China’s  propaganda  apparatus  by 
providing behavioral data, audience surveys, advertising tools, 
and other support. Additionally, while beyond the scope of this 
report, it is noteworthy that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA; 
中国人民解放军) is very likely exploring and implementing precise 
communication as part of its own influence operations.39

Preparing the Keys: Understanding the Audience

Tailoring  content  according  to  the  beliefs  and  interests  of 
target audiences, party-state media and other elements of the 
propaganda  apparatus  requires  as  strong  an  understanding  as 
possible of those audiences. Propaganda and Thought Work in 
the New Era, CCP leaders, party-state media practitioners, and 
academics  all  agree  on  this  point.40  Country  studies  research, 
in-country  surveys,  and  online  behavioral  data  are  the  means 
of attaining this understanding; indeed, the internet and social 
media  are  what  make  increasingly  granular  forms  of  precise 
communication possible in both political and marketing contexts.41 
As  implementation  of  precise  communication  deepens,  such 
data will almost certainly increasingly shape the CCP’s external 
propaganda  output  —  the  “keys”  that  will  “unlock”  different 
international audiences.

After Xi Jinping’s 2016 remarks emphasizing “research [into] 
the  habits  and  characteristics  of  different  foreign  audiences”, 
Hu Bangsheng stressed the necessity of conducting “empirical 
research on different countries, regional research, and audience 
research”  in  2017.42  A  researcher  affiliated  with  the  Wenzhou 
University  Public  Opinion  and  Online  Information  Security 
Research  Center  (温州大学舆情与网络信息安全研究中心)  likewise 
asserted  in  2018  that  implementing  One  Country,  One  Policy 
necessitates  “fully  surveying,  researching,  and  analyzing  the 
political  background,  legal  system,  ethnic  religion,  customs, 
and cultural traditions, [and other elements] of the audiences of 
different  countries  .  .  .  [and]  making  external  [communicators] 
become specialized talent that ‘knows some country’ or ‘knows 
some  aspect  of  some  country’”.  The  director  of  the  National 
Discourse  Research  Center  (国家话语研究中心)  at  Suzhou 
University of Science and Technology (苏州科技大学) has further 
highlighted  the  requirement  of  “strengthening  regional  and 
country theoretical studies . . . on-the-ground survey research… 
[and  achieving]  a  basic  understanding  of  a  specific  audience 
group’s interests, hobbies, needs, and values”. 

A  topic  of  discussion  for  a  third  or  more  of  precise 
communication research articles since 201543 is the role of big 
data  and  AI  (see  Figure  2).  Multiple  researchers,  including  the 
director of Xinhua’s Journalism Research Institute, have argued 
that “user portraits” (用户画像) created on the basis of “interest 
tags”  (兴趣标签)  and  other  personal  information  and  online 
behavioral  data  are  a  requirement  for  implementing  precise 
communication.  As  early  as  2014,  the  then-executive  deputy 
director (常务副主任) of the Global Times Public Opinion Survey 

Center (环球舆情调查中心), a  subsidiary of Global Times (环球时
报), suggested that such data could be used to identify audience 
preferences,  the  appropriate  voice,  and  the  best  time  for 
disseminating information as part of determining not just “what 
to  say”  (说什么)  but  also  “how  to  say  it”  (怎么说)  for  maximum 
effect.44 Writing about domestic propaganda in 2017, the then-
editor-in-chief (总编辑) of People’s Daily Online and president of 
the People’s Daily Online Research Institute (人民网研究院) went 
further, suggesting that precise communication should also be 
informed by combining an individual’s behavioral data with data 
about their physical setting (场景). 45 

In a co-authored 2021 article, the director of, and a public 
opinion  analyst  (舆情分析师)  from,  China  Daily’s  International 
Communication  Research  Office  (中国日报社国际传播研究室) 
acknowledged the need for surveys and behavioral data. They 
stress  that  Chinese  media  needs  to  use  “internet  technology” 
and  “big  data  technology”  to  continue  improving  its  ability  to 
produce information according to international opinion and based 
on the kind of reporting that has worked in the past. This effort, 
the  authors  write,  demands  “strengthening  overseas  audience 
research”, which can be facilitated by “new media methods” (that 
is,  data  collection)  and  “cooperation  with  international  third-
party survey consulting companies”; more closely studying how 
readers  interact  with  published  media  items  (also  pointing  to 
behavioral data); and creating a “3-in-1 ‘public opinion-audience-
effect’  monitoring  system”.  Writing  in  June  2022,  the  editor-
in-chief  of  China  Daily  asserted  that  the  outlet’s  international 
communications  research  departments  are  focused  on  “using 
big  data,  artificial  intelligence,  and  other  methods  to  achieve

precision-ization  [精准化]”  as  part  of  establishing  a  “good 
foundation  for  enhancing  [China’s]  ability  to  set  the  agenda“. 
Notably,  the  focus  on  bulk  data  is  not  limited  to  discussion  of 
precise  communication  but  relates  to  broader  thinking  on  how 
AI  and  data  can  empower  the  propaganda  apparatus  to  more 
effectively preempt and mitigate threats.46 

Country and Audience Surveys

A major contributor to China’s survey efforts is the Academy 
of  Contemporary  China  and  World  Studies  (ACCWS;  当代中国
与世界研究院),  a  think  tank  subordinate  to  the  China  Foreign 
Languages Publishing Administration (CFLPA; 中国外文出版发行事
业局), which is itself a work unit of the CCP’s Central Propaganda 
Department.47  Since  2013,  ACCWS  has  produced  the  annual 
China National Image Global Survey Report (中国国家形象全球调
查报告). 48  International  market  research  firms,  namely  Millward 
Brown,  Lightspeed  Research,  and  Kantar  Group  (which  owns 
the first 2 firms49), have conducted the surveys for all of these 
publications. These and other surveys create data that Chinese 
media  and  the  propaganda  apparatus  use  to  demonstrate 
China’s  achievements  under  the  CCP’s  leadership,  as  well  as 
data that almost certainly informs communication strategy and 
international communication planning.

ACCWS’s  surveys  evaluate  current  perceptions  of  China 
in  different  parts  of  the  world  and  ask,  since  2014,  forward-
looking  questions  about  what  different  groups  want  to  see. 
They ask respondents which China-related topics they are most 
interested in, with response options including politics, military, 
sports, culture, and other categories. They also ask respondents 
in which areas they would like to see China play a larger role in 
global governance, with response options including economics, 
security,  ecology,  and  other  areas.  Responses  to  these  and 
similar questions are typically broken out into developed versus 
developing countries and 3 different age groups for the public 
report.  Although  ACCWS’s  reports  do  not  dwell  on  country 
differences or differences between respondents of different age 
groups in various countries, it is clear that the surveys generate 
such data.

ACCWS also conducts other, more focused survey research 
to  understand  perceptions  of  China.  For  example,  ACCWS 
presented  results  from  its  study  titled  “China  and  the  World  in 
the  Eyes  of  International  Youth”  (国际青年眼中的中国与世界)  in 
October 2021. Since at least 2014, ACCWS, in partnership with 
1 or more of the foreign firms named above and other entities in 
China, has produced a series of reports on international views 
toward Chinese enterprises. The 2020 edition of these reports 
focused  on  12  countries  participating  in  the  Belt  and  Road 
Initiative.50 

Party-state  media  outlets  further  fund  their  own  survey 
research to improve foreign-facing products. For example, China 
Xinhua  News  Network  Corporation  (CNC;  中国新华新闻电视网有
限公司) 51  sought  to  evaluate  its  international  communication  in 
October 2017.52 According to procurement records, the contract 
winner  agreed  to  conduct  surveys  in  New  York,  London,  and 
“major countries and cities in Africa” to help CNC understand its 
overall effect internationally; understand the effects of its “major 
international  partnered  communications”,  overseas  distribution 
centers,  documentaries,  and  other  projects;  and  learn  how  to 
increase  its  competitiveness  by  retaining  current  audiences 
and  attracting  new  viewers.  The  project  was  sole-sourced  to 
CTR Market Research (央视市场研究股份有限公司), a joint venture 
between China International Television Corporation (国国际电视
总公司) and Kantar Group. 53

In June 2021, CMG54 similarly solicited bids for conducting 
surveys to understand the reach and impact of their worldwide 
TV, broadcast, website, and social media presence.55 According 
to  the  tender  announcement,  CMG  budgeted  7.5  million  RMB 
(approximately  1.2  million  USD)  for  this  project  and  sought  to 
collect data from no less than 500 people in each of 52 countries 
and  41  languages.56  The  surveys  were  required  to  evaluate 
the  visibility,  contact,  spread,  trust,  satisfaction,  favorability, 
authority,  market  competitiveness,  and  comprehensive 
communication power of CMG’s various dissemination channels. 
They  were  further  intended  to  address  the  overall  efficacy  of 
CMG’s content in all languages within a single country, as well 
as  the  overall  efficacy  of  CMG’s  content  across  all  countries 
speaking a given language. The final deliverable was also required 
to include summaries of the culture and media environment (such 
as which short-form and long-form video platforms are popular) 
of all countries surveyed. Global Times 4-D Market Survey, also 
known as the Global Times Public Opinion Survey Center, won a 
modified version57 of this tender.58

Party-state  media  and  other  entities  are  also  leading  the 
creation  of  new  research  entities  to  explore  target  audience 
attitudes  in  more  depth.  For  example,  China  Daily  established 
a  Generation  Z  Research  Center  (Z世代研究中心)  in  2022  with 
“the  Department  of  Sociology  of  Peking  University,  the  School 
of  Journalism  of  Fudan  University  in  Shanghai,  the  School  of 
International  Journalism  and  Communication  at  Beijing  Foreign 
Studies  University,  the  Institute  of  Sociology  at  the  Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences, the Bilibili Institute for Public Policy 
and the Beijing Shengtao Institute of Educational Development 
and  Innovation”.59  The  results  of  a  2022  Global  Generation 
Z  Insights  Report,  “based  on  questionnaires  and  in-depth 
interviews with 3,000 young people in 50 countries and regions, 
including China, France, Egypt, South Korea, the United Kingdom 
and  the  US”,  were  released  at  the  inaugural  ceremony  of  this

new  think  tank.  Earlier,  in  2021,  China  Daily  reportedly  signed 
a  cooperation  agreement  with  the  External  Propaganda  Office 
of Shanghai (上海市委外宣办) to  establish a think tank aimed at 
“innovation for ‘Generation Z’ international communication theory 
and practice”.

Behavioral Data Collection

Public opinion monitoring is an industry unto itself in China, 
write  Jessica  Batke,  ChinaFile  senior  editor,  and  Dr.  Ohlberg. 
In  addition  to  serving  commercial  and  security  purposes,  this 
industry  supports  the  work  of  party-state  media  in  China 
and  abroad.  The  companies  and  research  centers  that  offer 
international  public  opinion  monitoring  and  related  online 
marketing  services  provide  a  basis  for  conducting  precision 
communication.  Demonstrating  that  the  link  between  such 
services  and  information  influence  is  recognized  in  China,  an 
associate  senior  public  opinion  analyst  (主任舆情分析师)  at  the 
People’s  Daily  Online  Public  Opinion  Data  Center  (人民网舆情数
据中心)  has  pointed  to  the  2016  US  election  influence  scandal 
involving Cambridge Analytica — whose core service is “better 
audience targeting” — and Facebook in discussing the “guidance 
and intervention” phase of public opinion research.60 During the 
2020  US  presidential  election,  the  People’s  Daily  Online  Public 
Opinion  Data  Center  reportedly  “carried  out  collection  of  all 
content issued by the personal . . . accounts of Joe Biden and 
Donald  Trump”  on  a  popular  American  social  media  platform. 
The center further conducted analyses to “compare differences 
in the political persons, key opinion leaders [KOL; 关键意见领袖], 
and media that often engaged” with Biden and Trump. 

China  Daily  likewise  seeks  to  harness  foreign  online  data 
through  commercial  industry  to  understand  the  effects  of  its 
reporting, guide topic selection, and be forewarned of sensitive 
events.  For  instance,  China  Daily  is  a  “partner”  (合作伙伴)  of 
China Data Matrix Technology (Beijing) Limited (中数经纬科技(北
京)有限公司), and the China Daily (Hong Kong) Big Data Center 
(中国日报(香港) 大数据中心  specifically  is  almost  certainly  a 
client of this company. China Data Matrix is a media monitoring 
company that claims to have “complete coverage” of Facebook, 
Pinterest,  Instagram,  Linkedin,  YouTube,  Line,  and  other  major 
platforms,  web  portals,  communities,  forums,  and  blogs  from 
over  100  countries  and  10  languages.  Their  products  support 
“coverage and dynamic updating of foreign social media KOL in 
every  country,  [with]  precise  and  real-time  directed  collection 
and monitoring”, and are capable of generating user portraits.

Xinhua  News  Agency  has  a  subsidiary  known  as  Beijing 
Xinhua Multimedia Data (北京新华多媒体数据有限公司), or Xinhua 
Data  (新华大数据)  for  short,  which  operates  a  Public  Opinion 
Monitoring  Platform  (“新华大数据”舆情监测平台)  that  collects 

data from 4,500 foreign websites, including some in Hong Kong, 
Macau,  and  Taiwan.  Xinhua  Data’s  “partners”  include  Xinhua 
News  Agency,  Xinhuanet  (新华网), 61  People’s  Daily  Online,  and 
CCTV.  On  a  single  popular  American  social  media  platform, 
Xinhua’s platform covers 6 million accounts, “supporting search 
and collection on more than 2,000 key words”. This is less than 
3% of the platform’s overall user base, suggesting Xinhua is likely 
selectively targeting accounts (or types of accounts) of interest. 
Procurement  documents  analyzed  by  The  Washington  Post’s 
Cate  Cadell  likewise  show  that  party-state  media  and  others 
have sought programs that monitor prominent foreign journalists, 
academics,  and  “key  personnel  from  political,  business  and 
media  circles”.  Other  companies  appear  to  cast  a  much  wider 
net; Global Tone Communications Technology (中译语通科技股份
有限公司), a company indirectly subordinate to the CCP’s Central 
Propaganda Department, “facilitates bulk data collection . . . from 
traditional and social media”. The company “claims that one of 
its . . . [media monitoring] platforms . . . collects 10 terabytes of 
data per day, and about 2–3 petabytes per year”. 

In some cases, there appears to be a discrepancy between 
the marketing of companies and research centers in the public 
opinion monitoring industry and their actual capabilities. Beijing 
TRS  Information  Technology  (北京拓尔思信息技术股份有限公司), 
whose  clients  include  People’s  Daily,  Xinhua,  and  other  major 
outlets,  offers  a  platform  that  claims  to  collect  from  foreign 
sources. However, the company’s sample products demonstrating 
collection capability during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests 
in the US indicate that “62.16 percent of more than 23.5 million 
messages and articles analyzed . . . were pulled from Weibo or 
WeChat. In contrast, just 3.43 percent of the messages analyzed 
came from non-Chinese media sources”. 

Still,  it  is  clear  that  the  party-state  is  intent  on  pursuing 
research  into  technologies  and  data  processing  techniques 
that  will  facilitate  improvements  to  AI’s  application  in  targeted 
external  propaganda  work.62  The  International  Communication 
Big  Data  Intelligent  Laboratory  (国际传播大数据智能实验室),  for 
instance,  is  a  research  entity  dedicated  to  this  pursuit.  This 
laboratory  was  jointly  established  in  April  2019  by  the  CFLPA 
and  Renmin  University  of  China  (中国人民大学),  specifically  the 
Gaoling  School  of  Artificial  Intelligence.  In  September  2021, 
the  laboratory  began  soliciting  bids  for  research  on:  “Model 
Construction  and  Strategy  of  International  Communication  Big 
Data Region and Country Profiles”; “Intelligent Profile Modeling 
for International Communication with Youth Groups on the Mobile 
Internet”;  and  “Big  Data  Evaluation  Model  for  the  Influence  of 
International Social Media Opinion Leaders”.

Opening the Locks: Delivering Tailored Content

The  adoption  of  a  precise  communication-based  strategy 
is  moving  the  CCP’s  entire  propaganda  apparatus  toward  the 
creation and dissemination of media products that are tailored to, 
and intended to be enjoyable for, specific segments of audiences. 
To do this, the CCP is relying on media localization, joint content 
production  partnerships,  distribution  contracting,  and  almost 
certainly advertising tools from international internet companies. 
Xi  Jinping  asserted  in  2015  that  “wherever  audiences  are  .  .  . 
that is where the focus of propaganda and thought work is and 
[where its] foothold must be placed”. Considered alongside the 
tenets of the precise communication strategy defined above, this 
means  finding  groups  who,  from  the  party’s  perspective,  need 
to be influenced and giving them bespoke products embedded 
with the CCP’s messages — that is, using targeted propaganda 
to turn these “locks”. 

into  Blockbusters  for  the  World  to  See’”  and  of  “‘perfectly 
integrating stories of revolutionary history with the international 
communication  discourse  system  in  a  way  that  foreigners  find 
easy  to  understand  and  accept’”.  China  Media  Project  also 
found  the  show  “truly  entertaining”  at  times,  noting  that  this 
has  historically  been  a  rare  achievement  for  China’s  external 
propaganda products.

Distribution  agreements  with  foreign  media  are  another 
form of localization. An example of this tactic is seen in China 
Daily’s  “China  Watch”  (中国观察报)  content,  which  in  2021  was 
“designed  according  to  the  situations  of  different  countries, 
different languages, and different audiences” and inserted into 
30  foreign  media  outlets  in  23  countries.  Also  in  2021,  China 
Daily disseminated 17,000 articles in various languages to more 
than 200 “foreign mainstream media web portals and platforms”, 
a 143% increase from the previous year.

Media Localization

Discussing  both  precise  communication  and  One  Country, 
One  Policy,  Propaganda  and  Thought  Work  in  the  New  Era 
calls on CCP cadres to “deepen implementation of the [media] 
localization strategy. . . . connect [接] to local ‘flavor’ [本土“地气”], 
assemble local ‘personalities’ [当地“人气”] . . . [and] encourage the 
creation of overseas localized production centers, dissemination 
centers, [and] promotion centers”, among other actions.63 A form 
of deeper localization beginning in 2015 is seen in the relationship 
between  the  American  media  conglomerate  Discovery  and  the 
China  Intercontinental  Communication  Center  (CICC;  五洲传播
中心). 64 These entities have collaborated since at least 2004 to 
create  China-related  TV  programming,  and  strengthened  their 
partnership  in  2015  when  they  signed  a  3-year  agreement  to 
launch  “a  dedicated  programming  block”  called  “Hour  China”. 
This  block  was  aired  “weekly  on  Discovery  Channel  across 
[the] Asia-Pacific, reaching more than 90 million viewers in 37 
countries and territories”, and was reportedly “the first time that 
an international media company . . . launched a . . . programming 
block of this scale dedicated solely to China”. That same year, 
“Xinhua and the China Daily newspaper started using automatic 
geolocation to redirect [users] to a specific language version of 
their page on Facebook”.

In  late  2021,  Discovery’s  Southeast  Asia  Channel  and 
some regional versions of the online platforms Discovery+ and 
Amazon  Prime  Video  began  airing  Journey  of  the  Warriors,  a 
joint  production  between  Discovery,  Tencent  Video  (腾讯视频), 
and CICC. Research on this show by China Media Project finds 
that the “‘adventure documentary’”, which follows 5 celebrities 
as they retrace the Long March, has been recognized in China 
as an example of “‘Turning External Propaganda Documentaries 

At  least  some  distribution  agreements  include  explicit 
requirements  related  to  precise  communication.  In  2019,  the 
government  of  Hainan  and  Russia’s  state-owned  news  agency 
TASS  signed  a  cooperation  agreement.  Procurement  records 
from December 2021 related to this 5-year agreement state that 
it is intended to “strengthen communication of Sanya’s65 policies, 
opportunities,  and  achievements  in  Belt  and  Road  Initiative 
countries . . . by sticking closely to the precise communication 
methods  of  [differentiating  between]  different  areas,  different 
countries,  and  different  groups”.66  A  contract  issued  to  the 
Hainan-based  media  company  that  manages  the  relationship 
with TASS — Hainan Hesi Zhongmei Cultural Media Company (
海南合思众美文化传媒有限责任公司) — stipulates that coverage of 
Hainan should be distributed, presumably by TASS, via:

•  Other Russian news outlets and those in Belarus, 

Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan

•  Social media, including Facebook, YouTube, and Russian 
social media platforms VKontakte (VK) and Odnoklassniki 
(OK)

•  Russian-speaking key opinion leaders (KOLs)

Furthermore,  distribution  platforms  and  target  audiences 
should be prioritized based on age, profession, income, education 
level, industry, and interests.67 The overall goal of the contract is 
to attract “famous international firms” and “exceptional talent” to 
Hainan, as well as target Generation-Z audiences.68

Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com

Global internet companies offer a similar opportunity to that 
seen  in  the  TASS  contract,  whereby  precise  communication 
goals  are  furthered  by  providing  access  to  audience  data  that 
party-state media would otherwise be challenged to obtain. In 
case  studies  for  the  ChinaTalk  newsletter,  Maggie  Baughman 
has  highlighted,  based  on  procurement  records,  how  Chinese 
government  entities  are  almost  certainly  benefiting  from 
Facebook’s  advertising  tools.  At  least  2  government  tourism 
departments  have  contracts  with  Beijing  Yiqilian  Technology 
Company (北京亿起联科技有限公司), whose platform “PandaMobo” 
(熊猫新媒) is an “official partner” (官方合作伙伴) of Google, TikTok, 
Facebook,  and  other  prominent  platforms.  On  Facebook,  and 
presumably  with  the  help  of  its  audience  analytics,  Beijing 
Yiqilian runs a “Visit Xiamen” page and distributes other content 
that  contributes  to  perceptions  of  China.  These  tools  include 
data  on  user  age,  gender,  interests,  behavior,  and  “precise” 
location.69 Although the focus of the Hainan-TASS and Yiqilian’s 
local government contracts described here is not overtly political, 
economy and tourism are part of CCP external propaganda work 
and contribute to China’s overall international image.70 Moreover, 
these  pathways  are  almost  certainly  the  same  as  those  that 
overt political narratives will flow through.

Social Media Differentiation

How  China’s  diplomats  and  party-state  media  use  foreign 
social media accounts is also very likely informed by the tenets of 
precise communication. At the inaugural China Internet Civilization 
Conference (中国网络文明大会) in 2021, MFA spokesperson Zhao 
Lijian (赵立坚) asserted that “we” — presumably meaning China 
writ large, which includes the diplomatic corps — “use language 
that Western audiences understand, methods that [make them] 
listen  [听得进],  [and]  content  that  [they  will]  believe  to  make 
China’s  narrative  become  the  world  narrative  and  international 
consensus”. 

As of March 1, 2021, there were at least 270 Chinese diplomats 
stationed in 126 countries that had accounts on major international 
social  media  platforms.  Most  diplomatic  accounts,  including 
those  for  embassies  and  consulates,  were  created  in  or  after 
2015, with a surge in 2019 (see Figure 4). Their communications, 
especially  those  with  more  personalized  accounts,  have  been 
analyzed  in  the  context  of  precise  communication  by  Chinese 
researchers. For example, scholars from the Arab Studies Institute 
at Beijing Foreign Studies University (北京外国语大学阿拉伯学院) 
argue  that  China’s  ambassador  to  Saudi  Arabia,  Chen  Weiqing 
(陈伟庆), addresses the “information and cultural psychological 
needs”  of  his  audience,  attends  to  the  “issue  of  ‘what  does 
the  audience  want  to  understand’  and  ‘what  do  we  want  the 
audience to understand’”, and achieves “precise communication”. 
Chen,  the  authors  assert,  presents  himself  as  an  “old  friend”, 
lively, kind, modest, and cultured, instead of as a “serious and 
cautious diplomat in the traditional sense”, thereby increasing the 
“affinity” of his messages among the target audience. They find 
that 97% of Chen’s posts are in Arabic, and that Chen focuses on 
cultural topics (such as calligraphy) and social issues (such as 
youth employment) while expressing respect for and interest in 
Saudi Arabian culture and development. The latter emphasis, the 
scholars assert, is in contrast to the criticism that Saudi Arabia 
receives from the West.

A 2022 analysis by BBC Monitoring and CASM Technology 
of  691  international  social  media  accounts  used  by  China’s 
ambassadors,  consular  officials,  the  MFA,  and  Confucius 
Institutes found variations in the content pushed toward different 
regions (see Figure 3). For instance, “Africa, the Asia Pacific and 
the Americas saw a greater emphasis on Covid”, while “Europe 
and  the  Americas  saw  much  greater  emphasis  on  culture”  and 
“the Middle East saw a greater emphasis on politics”.

or English according to topic (Source: BBC Monitoring)

Party-state media outlets have steadily created accounts on 
international social media since the “2009-2020 Overall Plan for 
Building  My  Country’s  Key  Media  International  Communication 
Capabilities” was initiated (see Figure 4). These include multiple 
accounts for a single outlet that are meant to cater to audiences 
in different regions. Perhaps the clearest example of how party-
state media is very likely implementing precise communication 
on  social  media  is  the  proliferation  of  influencer  personas, 
which is discussed in the following subsection. However, some 
of  the  content  distributed  both  on  social  media  and  on  party-
state  media  websites  appears  intended  —  in  accordance  with 
precise communication — to blend CCP narratives into popular 
culture  and  image-  and  song-based  viral  internet  culture  (in 
other words, meme culture). For example, in April 2022, Global 
Times  published  a  video  to  YouTube  of  a  series  of  political 
cartoons  containing  “hidden”  messages  and  set  to  music  that 
depicted the US as an evil global hegemon. Among the images 

are renderings of Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter books, 
in  the  Oval  Office,  and  a  masked  presidential  figure  sitting  on 
the  Iron  Throne  of  the  Game  of  Thrones  TV  show,  also  in  the 
Oval Office (see Figure 5 and Figure 6). The English version of 
People’s  Daily  Online  has  published  cartoons  likening  the  US 
to Voldemort as well, and Xinhua has disseminated refutations 
of  US  criticisms  of  China  related  to  COVID-19  in  the  form  of 
mock trading cards that imitate the Japanese game Yu-Gi-Oh! 
Although  not  explicitly  acknowledged,  this  style  of  content  is 
likely intentionally designed with precise communication in mind; 
the apparent goal is to appeal to people who enjoy these popular 
products (Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and Yu-Gi-Oh!).

Influencers and Newsletters

The CCP’s growing use of influencers, KOLs, and other forms of 
personalized communication is very likely informed (if not driven) 
by the precise communication strategy, with research discussing 
these  concepts  together  limited  but  growing  (see  Figure  7). 
In  2021,  an  editor  (编辑)  with  Xinhua’s  Journalism  Research 
Institute co-authored research into “personal brands” (个人IP 73) 
for external propaganda.74 This research argued that “using the 
free, flexible . . . [and] witty forms of personal accounts to carry 
out communication is better able to [achieve] strong resonance 
with  overseas  netizens”.75  It  further  advocated  expanding  the 
use of influencers, in part by establishing friendships with “key 
opinion  leaders  in  different  areas  [and  in]  different  circles  and 
strata”.76  Although  this  article  does  not  specifically  mention 
precise  communication,  what  is  being  described  is  in  line  with 
the overall strategy. Some researchers, such as Hu Zhengrong 
and his co-author cited above, do explicitly assess that internet 
personalities  would  be  effective  implementers  of  their  target 
audience “grouping” concept (see Appendix A). This is because 
they can take advantage of “the short video format” and because 
“new  media  push  [features]  .  .  .  are  highly  flexible  [and]  can 
adjust  personal  setting,  content  theme,  and  expressive  forms 
at  any  time”  based  on  their  platform  metrics  and  audience 
feedback. Researchers affiliated with Tsinghua University have 
further  suggested  that  establishing  a  “personalized  [KOL] 
matrix”  could  help  target  different  audiences,  as  well  as  take 
advantage of diminished trust in mainstream media (particularly 
in the US). These researchers also argue that influencers can be 
used  to  overcome  political  pressure  and  “cancel  culture”  (取消
文化) that have led to the accounts of party-state media figures 
and  Chinese  diplomats  being  labeled  as  such  on  international 
social media platforms.

The  alleged  social  media  activities  of  OneSight  (Beijing) 
Technology  (一网互通（北京）科技有限公司)  —  which  has  held 
party-state  media  contracts  in  the  past  —  further  bridge  the 
gap  between  data  collection,  implementation  of  personalized 
communication, and the use of inauthentic social media accounts. 
OneSight is a marketing company that provides “overseas social 
media real-time public opinion monitoring” and a “growth platform 
based  in  overseas  social  media  user  behavior”.  Their  products 
collect data from Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and 
other  major  services  and  can  generate  user  portraits  with  the 
goal  of  facilitating  “precise  positioning  marketing”  (精准定位营
销).  In  2018  and  2019,  the  company  had  contracts  with  China 
News Service (中国新闻社 and 中国新闻网) to promote the outlet 
on American social media platforms.71 In 2021, the company won 
a contract for “advertising promotion” of a China Daily subsidiary 
on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and other sites.72 In 
August 2019, ProPublica began tracking a “coordinated influence 
campaign” related to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong 
that year and later to COVID-19. The campaign involved more than 
10,000 fake or hacked accounts, including those with personas 
such  as  the  wife  of  a  Hong  Kong  policeman  and  branding  that 
imitated foreign news sources like Radio Free Asia. ProPublica’s 
investigation tentatively linked the campaign to OneSight, whose 
marketing materials imply the company can create “more natural 
and healthy”-looking followers.

The  very  likely  China-linked  DRAGONBRIDGE  influence 
campaign  documented  by  Mandiant  since  2019  also 
demonstrates  tactics  that  align  with  precise  communication 
and show a notable understanding of DRAGONBRIDGE’s target 
environment  and  the  factors  that  could  influence  its  specific 
targets.  Mandiant  assesses  that,  in  early  to  mid-2022,  these 
targets were US and Canadian competitors of Chinese firms in 
the  rare  earths  industry.  To  undermine  these  competitors,  the 
campaign’s inauthentic accounts posed “as residents in Texas to 
feign concern over environmental and health issues surrounding” 
the  development  of  a  specific  rare  earth  minerals  processing 
facility in the US state. The accounts further amplified genuine 
criticism  from  “both  ends  of  the  political  spectrum”  related  to 
President Biden’s use of the Defense Production Act to increase 
America’s supply of critical minerals. DRAGONBRIDGE reportedly 
spans “30 social media platforms and over 40 additional websites 
and niche forums”. English, Chinese, Russian, German, Spanish, 
Korean, and Japanese are used to distribute content that has, at 
various times, sought to discredit the pro-democracy movement 
in Hong Kong, criticized CCP critics, and promote theories that 
COVID-19 originated in the US.

by Recorded Future)

Notably,  some  research  warns  against  overreliance  on 
influencers.  The  current  deputy  director  of  CUC’s  Institute 
for  a  Community  of  Shared  Future  (人类命运共同体研究院),  for 
instance,  has  argued  that  there  are  2  main  problems.  First, 
influencers primarily exist inside the digital economy, are subject 
to market forces, and often focus on their number of followers 
due to commercial incentives, which “does not equal the ability 
to guide public opinion”. These facts are at odds with the political 
and cultural mission of external propaganda and risk diminishing 
the state’s role in coordinating communication forces. Second, 
influencers  create,  or  tend  to  exist  in,  “virtual  clusters”  (虚拟
群集)  or  echo  chambers  because  audiences  are  built  through 
platform recommendations that match current user interests with 
influencer content. This, it is argued, may worsen cross-country 
and cross-cultural divisions in ways that are not conducive to the 
“current strategic requirements of international communication 
with the goal of building a community with a shared future for 
mankind”. 

Nevertheless, party-state media is pursuing this tactic. CMG 
established its International Communications Planning Bureau (国
际传播规划局) in July 2019 — well after the emergence of precise 
communication  —  with  plans  to  “actively  explore”  external 
propaganda “influencer studios” (网红工作室) as part of its efforts 
to “continuously improve influence among youth and mainstream 
groups [主流人群]”. CGTN and CRI, which are both  part of CMG, 
now  have  their  own  influencers  and  work  with  foreign  internet 
personalities. CRI in particular employs the majority of over 200 
influencers  tracked  by  Miburo  Solutions.77  They  collectively 
speak  “at  least  two  dozen  different  languages,  which  include 
widely spoken languages like Arabic, Hausa, and Spanish, as well 
as some lesser-known ones like Esperanto”.

Miburo  Solutions’s  research  into  the  activities  and  tailored 
messaging  of  state  media  influencers  does  not  identify  the 
precise  communications  concept,  but  their  findings  closely 
reflect its tenets and those of One Country, One Policy:

Country

Poland / 
Czechia78

Lifestyle influencers whose target audiences live 
primarily in developing countries often seek to portray 
China as a potential benefactor and a trustworthy 
diplomatic ally, while influencers that speak Southeast 
Asian languages focus on Chinese infrastructure 
projects in that region . . . Europe-focused influencers 
frequently discuss environmental issues and China’s 
importance as a global trade partner. Arabic-language 
influencers, by contrast, often present cheerful 
images of Muslim life in China and downplay the 
overwhelming evidence of systemic human rights 
abuses targeting Uyghurs and other Muslim minority 
groups.

This  kind  of  content  is  highly  similar  to  the  country-level 
precise communication content guidelines (see Table 1) proposed 
in  research  funded  by  CFLPA  on  international  communication 
efforts more broadly, conducted by a pair of researchers affiliated 
with Beijing International Studies University (BISU; 北京第二外国
语学院).  Specifically,  the  authors  are  from  BISU’s  Academy  of 
Culture and Communication (文化与传播学院) and the BISU CCP 
Committee-subordinate  External  Propaganda  Center  (党委宣传
部外宣中心).

Country

Suggested	Content	(Paraphrased)

Romania

Hungary

Latvia

Latvian people view the former Soviet 
Union as an invader and are wary of 
Russia. The country’s media expresses 
alarm over China’s economic model and 
the Belt and Road Initiative. Therefore, 
external propaganda should concentrate 
on China-Latvia economic cooperation 
and on how China has independently 
solved problems related to its economic 
development. External propaganda 
should avoid treating Latvia like a former 
partner in socialism and emphasize 
Latvia’s cultural contributions to Europe 
and the world.

Suggested	Content	(Paraphrased)

Poland and Czechia are China’s largest 
Eastern European trade partners. After 
the establishment of the Cooperation 
between China and Central and Eastern 
European Countries (China-CEE) platform 
and the Belt and Road Initiative, these 
countries’ “look west” policies turned 
toward developing trade with China. 
However, many dialogues and potential 
investments by Chinese companies have 
not materialized. External propaganda, 
therefore, should focus on guiding China-
Poland and China-Czechia company 
exchanges and creating inter-business 
dialogue mechanisms.

Romania experienced a violent regime 
change in 1989 and is still in a transitional 
period with wounds in its national 
memory. Romanians are not receptive 
to “the export of forceful concepts” (
强制性的概念输出). Therefore, external 
propaganda should respect this as well 
as respect Romania’s requirements 
related to environmental protection and 
(presumably corporate) competition.

Hungary is home to many Chinese 
investments and overseas Chinese. It 
was the first European Union member 
to join the Belt and Road Initiative and 
first to establish an RMB clearing bank. 
Hungarian media reports about China 
demonstrate the country is highly 
receptive to China and Hungarian people 
are very open to Chinese culture. Still, 
the influx of Chinese entrepreneurs and 
cheap products have caused problems. 
External propaganda, therefore, should 
focus on China’s high-tech development 
and the role of Chinese businesses in 
promoting the local economy.

Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com

While  the  content  of  lifestyle  influencers  is  likely  aimed 
at  mass  audiences,  English-language  newsletters  have  been 
assessed as serving precise communication aimed at elites. In 
a  2021  article  in  Chinese  Journalist  (中国记者),  the  associate 
senior editor (主任编辑) of Xinhua’s Journalism Research Institute 
evaluated  the  English-language  Pekingnology  newsletter79 
through this lens. This newsletter was founded by Wang Zichen 
(王子辰),  an  associate  senior  reporter  (主任记者)  in  the  Topical 
Commentary Office of the External Department of Xinhua News 
Agency’s Headquarters (总社对外部评论专题室) in Beijing.80 Based 
on  Pekingnology’s  success  —  it  has  some  3,900  subscribers 
that include “diplomats, correspondents, editors, think-tankers, 
professors,  lawyers,  and  investors”  —  the  Chinese  Journalist 
article asserts that newsletters offer a direct line to the desks 
of professionals and elite and are an “ideal carrier for ‘audience 
differentiated expression’”. 

Even  if  Pekingnology  and  other  newsletters  by  Xinhua 
journalists  like  Beijing  Channel  and  Ginger  River  are  personal, 
as their authors claim, they are very likely only allowed to exist 
because the Xinhua bureaucracy believes they serve the overall 
goals of China’s international communication. Like other official 
media, Xinhua carries out activities that outwardly appear more 
personal than they are. In discussing the social media activities 
of Xinhua journalist-turned-influencer Xu Zeyu (徐泽宇), who is 
active on Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms, a 2021 Xinhua 
news  article  states  that  toward  the  end  of  the  previous  year 
“Xinhua  News  Agency  especially  created  the  Xu  Zeyu  Studio, 
[which is] responsible for account content planning, production, 
[and] overseas promotion”. Xu Zeyu’s online presence, the article 
indicates, is a team and cross-departmental effort within Xinhua.

The Rest of the System

Party-state media localization efforts and, in particular, the 
CCP’s use of influencers, are emblematic of what the propaganda 
apparatus  as  a  whole  seeks  to  achieve.  Scholars  at  Renmin 
University  of  China’s  School  of  Journalism  (中国人民大学新闻学
院), for example, argued in late 2021 that external propaganda 
for Southeast Asia should pursue precise communication in the 
following ways:

•  In Laos and Cambodia: focus on TV and cultural shows

•  In Myanmar, Vietnam, and Malaysia: focus on new media 
including short videos and interactive cartoons to avoid 
domestic political controls over traditional media

•  In Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines, 

where the US has an advantage: focus on mobile internet 
platforms like Facebook while expanding the use of 
China’s mobile internet service providers so that it is 
easier to communicate China’s voice

In  addition  to  the  activities  of  CICC,  newsletter  authors, 
and  influencers  discussed  above,  Xinhua  has  profiled  the  One 
Country,  One  Policy  efforts  of  the  Chengdu  government  via 
YouTube,  which  includes  the  release  of  multiple  videos  and 
series on different topics meant to target audiences in Singapore, 
Japan, South Korea, and international youth (Generation-Z). In 
other  areas  such  as  publishing,  new  promotional  models  seek 
to  deepen  and  innovate  means  of  localization,  academics  are 
discussing how to improve united front work,81 and propaganda 
officials  urge  the  implementation  of  precise  communication’s 
tenets.  Research  published  by  Record  Future  has  previously 
documented  how  party-state  entities  and  Chinese  academics 
are researching ways to embed CCP narratives in a wide variety 
of  cultural  products  aimed  at  foreign  young  people,  including 
movies,  video  games,  and  events.  While  it  is  a  natural  impulse 
for any commercial industry to refine their products for maximum 
appeal  among  a  target  market,  the  distinction  in  China’s  case 
is that the CCP has a clear interest in mobilizing these cultural 
outputs in service of the party’s goals for itself and China.

Outlook

The  CCP’s  adoption  of  precise  communication  inherently 
entails continued — and even expanded — global data collection 
and research efforts. Accessing data on and understanding the 
psychology of target audiences is both a prerequisite of success 
and likely its greatest obstacle. Restrictions on the collection of 
personal behavioral data such as the European Union’s General 
Data Protection Regulation will challenge attempts to implement 
precise  communication  in  certain  jurisdictions.  However, 
advertisers themselves are seeking different ways to continue 
targeting  audiences,  such  as  through  contextual  ads  that  are 
based on what a person is currently looking at. Party-state media 
and the wider propaganda apparatus can be expected to follow 
those  trends  and  work  with  advertising  programs  to  share  the 
CCP’s messages. In jurisdictions that maintain lax data privacy 
laws, the CCP is likely to find more success.

Fur ther,  media  localization  effor ts  will  persist.  The 
propaganda apparatus and party-state media has demonstrated 
its  ability  to  adapt  and  deploy  (or  at  least  allow)  new  forms  of 
communications — entertaining TV, influencers, and newsletters. 
According  to  Georgia  State  University  Associate  Professor  Dr. 
Maria Repnikova, “over time, local journalists at Chinese outlets 
. . . might be able to reshape Chinese media practices”, including 
their level of balance and professionalism.82 This evolution will 
continue.  The  demonstrated  adaptability,  potential  effects  of 
localization, and overall purpose of precise communication are 
likely  to  lead  to  increasingly  diverse  content  produced  for  the 
countries and communities that the CCP seeks to influence. 

Finally, efforts by foreign social media companies to counter 
certain forms of influence, such as by labeling Chinese journalists 
as being affiliated with the state, are a further complication. For 
this reason, some researchers and media practitioners stress the 
importance  of  creating  and  promoting  China-owned  platforms 
(自有平台).  Efforts  to  support  the  internationalization  of  such 
platforms is likely to accelerate in the future.

Appendix A: Model for Classified, Stratified, and Grouped External Propaganda

This model for international communication was described in 2021 by Hu Zhengrong, former CUC dean and the head of the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences’ Journalism and Communication Research Institute, and a media practitioner affiliated with 
CMG’s Hong Kong-Macau-Taiwan Programs Center. The tables below are based on, and their contents closely paraphrased from, 
Hu and his co-author’s discussion of how classification, stratification, and grouping can be used to achieve precise communication. 
All examples of who to target and what content to use are identified in their research. The principal change made to Hu and his 
co-author’s writing is presenting classification first rather than beginning with stratification. This was done to move from broadest 
to narrowest targeting and for formatting purposes. For more information on this model, see the “Theories of Target Selection” 
section.

Appendix B: Methodology and Sources

This research draws from leadership speeches, authoritative documents, the writings of Chinese communication researchers 
and  party-state  media  practitioners,  the  actions  of  party-state  media  outlets,  procurement  records,  corporate  sources,  and 
previous foreign research. A 3-step process was used to create a sample of relevant sources that discuss, in whole or in part, 
precise communication and related concepts in relation to the CCP’s external propaganda work: 

Targeted  searches  were  conducted  on  People’s  Daily  Online  (人民网),  Qiushi  Online  (求是网;  QS  Theory),  the  International 
Communications (对外传播) periodical,83 and similar sources. A series of 5 successive searches, some comprising multiple queries, 
were conducted on a Chinese academic database to build a set of 2,104 unique academic articles (3,295 total academic articles 
across all searches) that were used to explore the relationship between various concepts and themes as seen in Figure 1, Figure 
2,  and  Figure  7.  The  specific  methodologies  for  each  of  these  figures  are  listed.  Irrelevant  articles,  such  as  those  related  to 
commercial advertising, were removed from the dataset based on title and the journal of publication. A portion of the articles in 
this  database  were  further  assessed  alongside  materials  from  the  sources  mentioned  above.  Additional  research  was  done  to 
find news media, academic materials, and corporate sources that elaborated on, or provided examples of, concepts discovered 
through the results of the previous 2 steps.

The book Propaganda and Thought Work in the New Era was also used. This work was collectively authored by the Cadre 
Bureau (干部局) of the CCP Central Propaganda Department. It was published by the Central Propaganda Department-subordinate 
Study  Publishing  House  (学习出版社)  in  December  2020  and  is  labeled  “cadre  training  teaching  material”  (干部培训教材).  Given 
these characteristics, Propaganda and Thought Work in the New Era is very likely an authoritative statement on how the CCP has 
determined to pursue ideological and propaganda work. Chapter 10 deals specifically with external propaganda aimed at overseas 
audiences. The edition of the book reviewed for this report was published in March 2021.

 This report uses “propaganda” to refer to all of the CCP’s information influence activities, including what are often referred to in foreign literature 
9 
as disinformation operations, as well as various forms of experiential influence. Precise communication is a strategic concept in domestic propaganda 
efforts in addition to overseas efforts, but specifically assessing its implementation within China lies outside of the scope of this research.
