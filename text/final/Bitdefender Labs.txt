Social media platforms offer immense opportunities for ﬁnancially motivated threat

actors to conduct large-scale attacks against unsuspecting Internet users. Fraudulent

and malicious threats are prevalent on all social networks and it has become crucial

for users to be aware of the latest tricks that can compromise the security of their

accounts, data, reputation and ﬁnances.

Cybercriminals always seek to trick users into taking all sorts of unwelcome actions,

and one way they achieve this is by abusing the ad network.

Bitdefender Labs has been monitoring the growing trend among cybercriminals who

actively exploit social media networks for malvertising. The end goal of these attacks

is to hijack accounts and steal personal data through malicious software.

Malvertising campaigns take advantage of the tools and methods used by legitimate

entities to distribute regular online ads, with cybercriminals submitting infected links

onto typical advertisement networks via some form of provocative enticement meant

to sway users into clicking on an infected link.

This write-up focuses on how cybercriminals have adapted NodeStealer attacks to

abuse Meta’s ads network on Facebook and compromise users’ privacy and security.

Here’s a summary of our analysis conducted Oct. 10-20:

Researchers discovered multiple hijacked Facebook accounts used in the

attacks – at least 10 compromised business accounts that continue to serve

malicious ads to the public

The ads serve a newer version of NodeStealer

The threat actors created multiple Facebook proﬁles, all of which dangle access

to new media ﬁles of the portrayed women

Multiple iterations of the same ad were used in about 140 malicious ad

campaigns

Attackers used a maximum of 5 active ads at a time and switched between them

at 24-hour intervals to try to avoid ad reports from users

The ads used revealing photos of young women to lure victims into deploying the

payload

Clicking on ads immediately downloads an archive containing a malicious .exe

“Photo Album” ﬁle which also drops a second executable written in .NET – this

payload is in charge of stealing browser cookies and passwords

Given that each ad click instantly downloads the malicious archive, we’ve

estimated 100,000 potential downloads from the Ad reach analysis, with a single

ad having as many as 15,000 downloads within just a 24-hour rollout

The most impacted demographic is 45+ Males

The above information regarding the demographic and reach of the campaign has

been collected by tracking the ads on Meta Ad Library.

Before delving into the speciﬁcs of the newly discovered NodeStealer campaign

that’s wreaking havoc on Facebook, let’s recap the particularities of this malicious

software.

NodeStealer is a relatively new info-stealer, discovered by Meta’s security team in

January 2023, that allows threat actors to steal browser cookies and conduct account

takeovers at scale.

The ﬁrst NodeStealer campaign (documented by Meta) was attributed to threat

actors in Vietnam, who custom-built the malicious tool (written in JavaScript and

executed through Node.js) to target business users via fake communications through

Facebook Messenger. The malware let attackers seize control of business accounts,

without the need for any further interactions with the victim, and even bypassed

security mechanisms such as two-factor authentication.

Although the stealer was primarily designed to hijack cookie sessions from web

browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave and Opera, and take over

Facebook accounts, threat actors have worked diligently to equip the malware with

new capabilities during the year.

The NodeStealer malware discovered by our researchers (let’s call it 2.1) is the

modernized version of the info-stealer (written in Node), to which cybercriminals have

added new features that allow them to obtain unlawful entry into additional platforms

(Gmail and Outlook), to steal crypto wallet balances and download additional

malicious payloads – components that could have devastating ﬁnancial and

reputational consequences for victims.

The malware is distributed via Windows executable ﬁles disguised as photo albums.

NodeStealer attack saga continues to plague Facebook - this time with a twist

Researchers at Bitdefender Labs have observed a fresh take on NodeStealer attacks

deployed on Facebook, with threat actors using compromised business accounts to

deliver malicious Ad campaigns to unwary internet users.

Modus Operandi:

According to Bitdefender researchers, threat actors are no longer interested in only

hijacking Facebook business accounts - they’ve expanded their attacks to target

regular Facebook users by using distinctive methods.

To gain access to users’ accounts and systems, cybercriminals abuse ad credit

balances of compromised business accounts to run and manage ads that deliver the

malicious payload to their select target audience.

They create a Facebook page under the name “Album Update” (or similar) where

they add revealing photos of young women (1 or 2 photos).

Other names of fake proﬁles include:

Album Girl News Update

Private Album Update

Hot Album Update Today

Album New Update Today

Album Private Update Today

After the page is set up, malicious actors begin running ads that promote fake new

content and entice users with lewd album covers. Some of the photos advertised

appear to have been edited or even AI-generated.

Attackers also use short descriptions to bait users into downloading the media

archive, such as “New stuff is online today” and “Watch now before it’s deleted.”

The “Albums,” in fact, point to either Bitbucket or Gitlab repositories that store an

archive containing a Windows executable that deploys newer versions of

NodeStealer onto the users’ device.

Meta’s Ads Manager tool is actively exploited in these campaigns to target male

users on Facebook, aged 18 to 65 from Europe, Africa and the Caribbean.

Bitdefender detects all malicious ﬁles as Gen:Variant.FacebookAd

What are consumers’ risks and how can you defend against NodeStealer ad

attacks?

Once cybercriminals gain access to users’ cookies using the basic features of

NodeStealer, they take over Facebook accounts and access sensitive information.

From there, hackers can attempt to change passwords and add additional security

measures to accounts to completely cut off access by the legitimate owner and

commit a variety of crimes of fraud. Whether stealing money or scamming new

victims via hijacked accounts, this type of malicious attack allows cybercrooks to stay

under the radar by sneaking past Meta’s security defenses.

The ﬁrst line of defense against Nodestealer malware, delivered via phishing links,

attachments or ads) is to always use a security solution on your device and keep it

up to date. Anti-malware and anti-virus software keep you and your devices safe

from new and existing threats by detecting malware and safely removing or stopping

it from causing any damage. Additionally, internet users should always stay vigilant

and stick to good cyber hygiene in all online interactions. It’s always best to think

twice before you click on unsolicited links associated with alarming notices or ads

that prompt you to download provocative media ﬁles.

Speciﬁcally for this campaign, Facebook users should steer clear of ads that suggest

you download photo albums from Bitbucket, Gitlab or Dropbox.
